# Installation

For SilverStripe versions 2.3.x you should follow [these instructions](2_3/)

Visit the URL /dev/build on your site; eg, http://localhost/mysite/dev/build or http://www.example.com/dev/build - you should see a Subsite table created, among other things.  

Once that has finished running, open the CMS. You should now see Subsites on the main menu in the top bar. Click it to open the subsite administrator.
