# Installing Subsites on SilverStripe 2.3

## Requirements

Silverstripe 2.3 and subsites requires [genericdataadmin Module](http://www.silverstripe.org/generic-data-admin-module)

## Download

Only certain revisions from the repository seem to be compatible ([source][1]). You can check out the required versions from the subversion repository by the following commands:  

`svn co http://svn.silverstripe.com/open/modules/subsites/trunk -r89242 subsites`
`svn co http://svn.silverstripe.com/open/modules/genericdataadmin/trunk -r76917 genericdataadmin`  

## Installation

Visit the URL /db/build on your site; eg, http://localhost/mysite/db/build or http://www.example.com/db/build - you should see a Subsite table created, among other things.

Once that has finished running, open the CMS. You should now see Subsites on the main menu in the top bar. Click it to open the subsite administrator.
