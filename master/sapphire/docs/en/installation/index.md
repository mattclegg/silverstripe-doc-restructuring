# Installing SilverStripe

## Download

SilverStripe is a web application.  This means that you will need to have a web server meeting SilverStripe's 
[requirements](server-requirements) running.

The installation instructions below will take you through setting up an appropriate web server on your system.  The
installation instructions will set you up with a SilverStripe website very similar to our [our demo
site](http://demo.silverstripe.com/) uses. 

You can [download](http://silverstripe.org/download) SilverStripe as a *.tar.gz archive or from subversion.

If you already have an installed version of SilverStripe, please see our [upgrading](upgrading) guide.

## Windows

We recommend that you use [Microsoft's free Web Platform installer](windows-pi). 

The more technically inclined can install using [Apache/WAMP](windows-wamp) or [IIS](windows-manual-iis).

## Mac OS X

Mac OS X comes with a built-in webserver, but you can also use MAMP [install SilverStripe using MAMP](mac-osx) or using MacPorts.

## Linux/Unix

If you run Linux/Unix, we generally assume that you know how to get a web-server going.

*  [Apache](webserver) - our preferred platform
*  [Lighttpd (lighty)](lighttpd) - fast, but a bit tricker to get going
*  [Nginx](nginx) - Super fast at serving static files. Great for large traffic sites.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble, see [common-problems](common-problems) or post to the 
[SilverStripe forums](http://silverstripe.com/silverstripe-forum/).
