# buildbot-try-server

**NOTE:** The try server is experimental and this information may not be up to date.  Talk to Sam Minn√©e if you want
more information.

Buildbot, our continuous integration server, has a facility called the "try server".  This will let you test your
changes before they are committed.

## How to set up your machine

 1.  First, install buildbot.

    * Windows users: http://buildbot.net/trac/wiki/RunningBuildbotOnWindows
    * OSX / linux users: http://buildbot.net/trac#DownloadInstall
 2.  Go to your svn-based working copy that contains changes.
 3.  Create an empty file called .buildbot-top
 4.  Run the following command

	
	buildbot try --wait --connect=pb --master=buildbot.silverstripe.com:8031 \
	--username=(username) --passwd=(password) --vc=svn \
	--builder=osx-alltrunkmodules --branch phpinstaller/trunk


Alternatively, you can remove the ''--wait'' option and just watch progress at

## How to get a username and password

To access the try server, you will need a username and password.  Because the try server is still experimental, we're
limiting access to currently active developers.
