# Release Maintainer

The current maintainer responsible for planning and performing releases is Ingo Schommer (ingo at silverstripe dot com).
# Release Planning

Our most up-to-date release plans are typically in the [roadmap](http://open.silverstripe.com/roadmap).
New features and API changes are typically discussed on the [core
mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/silverstripe-dev). They are prioritized by the core team as tickets on 
[open.silverstripe.org](http://open.silverstripe.com/). 

Release dates are usually not published prior to the release, but you can get a good idea of the release status by
reviewing the [release milestone](http://open.silverstripe.com/roadmap) on open.silverstripe.org. Releases will be
announced on the [release announcements mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/silverstripe-announce).

Releases of the *cms* and *sapphire* modules are coupled at the moment, they follow the same numbering scheme. Module
releases are documented separately in [module-releases](module-releases).
# Release Numbering


*  Versions are numbered by major version number, minor version number, and micro version number, in the form *A.B.C*
(e.g. *2.4.1*)

*  *A* is the *major version number*, which is only incremented for major changes and core rewrites, lots of them won't
be backwards compatible. 

*  *B* is the *minor version number*. It is incremented for our typical releases with new features and bugfixes. We
strive for few changes to be backwards incompatible, and will deprecate any APIs before removing them.

*  *C* is the *micro version number*, incremented for bugfixes, minor enhancements and security fixes. Unless
security-related, all changes will be fully backwards compatible to the minor version number.

*  Major and minor releases have an *alpha* cycle, which is a preview developer release which that see major changes
until release. It is followed by a *beta* cycle, which is feature complete and used by the wider development community
for stability and regression testing. Naming convention is *A.B.C-alpha* and *A.B.C-beta*.

*  Major, minor and micro releases can have one or more *release candidates (RC)*, to be used by the wider community. A
release candidate signifies that the core team thinks the release is ready without further changes. The actual release
should be a identical copy of the latest RC. Naming convention is *A.B.C-rc1* (and further increments).
## Major releases

So far, major releases have happened every couple of years. Most new releases are *minor version number* or *micro
version number* increments.
So far, we only had one major release, from the *1.x* to the *2.x* line.
## Minor releases

Minor releases have happened about once every 18 months. 
For example, *2.3* was released in February 2009, followed by *2.4* in May 2010.

These releases will contain new features, general enhancements and bugfixes. APIs from previous minor releases can be
*deprecated*, but will stay available for one more minor release. So, if an API is deprecated in *A.B*, it will continue
to work in *A.B+1*, and removed in *A.B+2*. 

An example: Say we'd want to rename *BasicAuth::requireLogin()* to follow our coding conventions, which is
*BasicAuth::require_login()*. The method was introduced in *2.1*, we've made the change in *2.3*?


*  *2.3* would've marked the method as *@deprecated*, and documents it as an *API CHANGE* in our
[:changelog](/changelog). The old method continues to work, but will throw an *E_USER_NOTICE*.

*  *2.4* would've removed the method, also documenting it as an *API CHANGE*, and mentioning it in the
[:upgrading](/upgrading) guidelines.

Exceptions to the deprecation cycle are APIs that have been moved into their own module, and continue to work with the
new minor release. These changes can be performed in a single minor release without a deprecation period.
## Micro releases

Micro releases are issued about every two months for the latest release, typically for security reasons.
You can safely upgrade to those releases (after reading the [:upgrading](/upgrading) guidelines).
For example, *2.3.6* was released in February 2010, followed by *2.3.7* in March 2010.

## Supported versions

At any point in time, the core development team will support a set of releases to varying levels:


*  The current *development trunk* will get new features and bug fixes that might require major refactoring before going
into a release (Note: At the moment, bugfixing and feature development might happen on the current release branch, to be
merged back to trunk regularly).

*  Applicable bugfixes on trunk will also be merged back to the last minor release branch, to be released as the next
micro release.

*  Security fixes will be applied to the current trunk and the previous two minor releases (e.g. *2.3.8* and *2.4.1*).
