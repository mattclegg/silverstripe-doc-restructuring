## Introduction

The main use of Technoratiservice is to create Metablogs by finding blog posts tagged under a given topic. For example
if you are holding an event, you can ask all its participants to tag their blog posts about the event in a   common name
(eg: FOSSCON06). So on the the event's site you can create a metablog by collecting all posts tagged under that name
with the help of Technoratiservice.

By default you will get the following built in component with technorati service :


*  [MetaBlog](MetaBlog) page type -  used to create a Meta blog based on a given tag
