# Secure Files

//More detail to be added once module has been reviewed.//

The module automatically creates a secure file
folder within the assets directory.

You can set user permissions in the Security tab.
You should see a new permission level "Access to
secure files". Granting this permission to users
will allow them to view the files in the secure
folder.

Note that administrative users will always be able
to access secure files. Note also that users with
asset admin access will be able to move and edit
files in the secure folder.
