##### 2.4.0-rc1 Changelog


#### Features and Enhancements

 * [101871] Updated automatic regression tests (Salad)
 * [101670] RedirectorPage ExternalURL field now defaults to http:// to be consistent with the "Another website" option
for !HtmlEditorField !LinkForm
 * [101661] tidied up installer process to streamline process. Moved requirements to top and button to bottom and added
visual seperation of the individual steps
 * [101381] refactored requirements section to hide successful tests
 * [101378] Added links to installation introduction text for sources of help and suggested web hosts
 * [101246] Improved wording and styling in installer. Added links to server requirements, themes download, tutorial.
Decreased vertical space before the "install" button to make it more obvious.
 * [101127] Added 'Dependent pages' tab to CMS, to show virtuals, redirectors, and backlinks that point to this page.


#### API Changes

 * [102012] Changed !MySQLFulltextSearchable class to !FulltextSearchable (applies to all databases)
 * [102003] Disallow methods/actions in !RequestHandler->checkAccessAction() which are implemented on parent classes
(e.g. !ViewableData and Object), unless access is controlled through $allowed_actions. This limits information exposure
from getters used in template contexts.
 * [101833] Allow cached blocks within control and if blocks, as long as that control or if block is contained within an
uncached block, not a cached block
 * [101155] Add option for !DataObjectDecorator::onAfterSkippedWrite()
 * [101137] Partial cache adjustments - now supports nested cache blocks (which are independant of their containing
cache block), conditionals to control if a given cache block is active, and includes hash of template code in key (so
template changes mean cache is invalidated). Changes template control for cache block to `<% cached %>`, to which the
now deprecated `<% cacheblock %>` is aliased, and an additional template control `<% uncached %>` has been added.
 * [101127] Added !SiteTree::!VirtualPages() and !SiteTree::!DependentPages() accessors.


#### Bugfixes

!SiteConfig is shown in TinyMCE

 * [102004] Prevent handling of controller actions which return $this avoid infinite loops in
!RequestHandler->handleRequest (thanks Hamish!)
 * [101975] Resetting image sidepanel fields when opening the panel instead of inserting an image, to avoid losing focus
of TinyMCE in IE. Using getBookmark() in TinyMCE to save the original location. (fixes #5263)

#5261)
 * [101737] RedirectorPage types shouldn't appear in "Pages with no content" side report in the CMS Pages tab

 * [101719] Only show "Roles" tab in admin/security if user has APPLY_ROLES permissions (fixes #5258)
 * [101711] Don't replace "home/" URLSegment in !SiteTree->!RelativeLink() if Translatable is enabled and the homepage
is not on the root level (nested URLs allows you to have homepages called "en/home" and "ru/home") (fixes #5244)
 * [101668] #5259 !RedirectorPage and !HtmlEditorField TinyMCE integration now prefixes http:// if no prefix is found

stage-independent, as get_version (open #5231)
 * [101602] IE does not accept TD element without a table, repacking into DIV (open #5228)
 * [101592] get a object inside transaction block will alway exist

this removed a vulnerability where unauthenticated users can disrupt mod_rewrite-less URL routing.
