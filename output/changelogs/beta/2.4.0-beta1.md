##### 2.4.0-beta1 Changelog

#### Overview

 * Support for SQLite and PostgreSQL databases (via separate module)
 * Partial caching in templates, to allow for faster load times of certain aspects in dynamic pages.
 * Upload controls in the CMS no longer require the Adobe Flash plugin, and work again on Mac OSX.
 * File and page dropdown selections support inline searching, to make handling larger tree structures easier.
 * Fixed password hashing design flaw, which makes SilverStripe databases more portable between different server
architectures.
 * Improved reporting API to unify the CMS sidebar reports and full-page reports on their own section. Its easier to add
custom filters to reports.
 * Batch action handling handles larger tree structures, provides better visual feedback, and respects permissions on
individual pages.
 * Global site configuration is translatable, meaning titles for your website can be in different languages without any
switching in your templates.
 * Allow selection of themes through the site configuration interface (in addition to changing the theme via
configuration code)
 * More fine-grained translation permissions: A group can be limited to only edit a certain language in the CMS.
 * Added dropdown to choose from existing anchor links when inserting a link from the CMS sidebar.
 * Team members can get permissions to see the draft version of a page in preview mode without requiring CMS access.
 * Pages of type "Virtual Page" have improved stability in regards to their permission control, translation and
publication.
 * Improved broken link detection (''talk to Andy for more info'')
 * Removed the jsparty/ toplevel folder, and moved all its dependencies into sapphire/thirdparty and cms/thirdparty
 * More than 350 bugfix and enhancement commits, and 200 minor changes.

#### Bugfixes

 * [98403] Fixed Hierarchy->loadDescendantIdList() to call setOwner() on the extension instance. This was necessary due
to underlying Object/Extension changes in 2.4.
 * [98382] #5044 Hierarchy::loadDescendantIDListInto() now uses Object::getExtensionInstance('Hierarchy') instead of
going through __call(), as PHP 5.3 has issues converting references to values
 * [98373] HTTP::setGetVar() uses parse_url() and http_build_query() to add query parameters to an existing URL, instead
of doing its own regex-based parsing. This means existing GET parameters are correctly url encoded.
 * [98324] Fixed !ContentController->deleteinstallfiles (added to $allowed_actions, see #5040)
 * [98272] Don't force SSL when running from CLI
 * [98265] Don't register member IDs that don't exist in the DB as being logged in.

 * [98168] Fixed report pagination, with or without search params (from r95555)
 * [98152] pagination was being applied (with a limit of NULL) to print and export actions. This was due to
$_REQUEST['methodname'] not existing. (from r97114)
 * [98150] TreeMultiselectField_Readonly now posts the correct value to the server (from r97100)
 * [98136] still use the correct methods to get a value, even if we're generating a CSV ($xmlSafe = false) (from r96212)
 * [98134] Don't default to sorted descending if you already have a different column sorted ascending. (from r96061)

 * [98132] Make !TableListField sort checking use SQLQuery::canSortBy() to let SSReprot_!FakeQuery work.
 * [98131] Correct direction of sort arrows in !TableListField (from r96051)
 * [98114] fixed test that was trying to do a assertContains between a !DataObjectSet and a Member object. Changed it to
an assertEquals between Member and the First item in the Set. Also added an inverse test to check that Set doesn't
contain the wrong Member.

 * [98094] Make SQLQuery return an appropriate count if a HAVING clause is used. (from r95814)

item was deep within the tree structure it would not be selected)
 * [98030] fixed member labels not appearing in cms popup. #5025
 * [98018] Fixed incorrect logic in CMSMain::generateTreeStylingJS() stopping different tree icons from working

 * [97912] Allowing translations of !VirtualPage by not copying over original Locale property (see #5000)
 * [97911] If a Group doesn't have any specific TRANSLATE_`<locale>` edit rights, but has general CMS access

avoid locking out CMS editors from their default language (see #4940 and 4941)
 * [97909] Don't let a user's theme break the CMS.

URL namespace)

 * [97730] fix front-end validation for DYMCalendarDateField, addressed in open ticket
#4967(http://open.silverstripe.org/ticket/4967).

phpValidation(), which is using is_numeric() (see #4874, thanks Allisone)
 * [97480] Checking for presence of all columns in Security::database_is_ready(). This was necessitated by an earlier
change to the sapphire ORM which now selects all columns explicitly in a SQL query (instead of SELECT *) (see #4027)
 * [97472] Setting 'Locale' as !HiddenField in CMSMain->getEditForm() to support translatable !SiteConfig records (see
