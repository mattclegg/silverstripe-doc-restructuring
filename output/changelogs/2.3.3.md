##### 2.3.3 Changelog


#### New Features

 * ![81467] Fixed Hierarchy->markChildren() to only mark nodes as unexpanded if they actually have children. This avoids
UI glitches with "plus"-icons beside unexpandable nodes, and prevents batch actions and !TreeNode->open() to trigger
ajaxExpansion on nodes without children (from r78339) (Merged via: r81971)

tabular view after saving a popup wasn't working because the search parameter wasn't retained (Merged via: r81962)
 * ![81450] If referrer had spaces, they would be encoded as %20, which would cause problems when interpolated into an
sprintf pattern. Inject instead.

 * ![79433] Object::add_extension() should only load statics for extensions of !DataObject, since it is specific to
!DataObjectDecorator (Merged via: r81698)
