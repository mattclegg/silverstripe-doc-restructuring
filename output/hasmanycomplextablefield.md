## Introduction

This [RelationTable](RelationTable) allows you to show a **1-to-many** relation with a group of DataObjects as a
(readonly) tabular list (similiar to [ComplexTableField](ComplexTableField)). Its most useful when you want to manage
the relationship itself thanks the **check boxes** present on each line of the table.

Moreover, you can not do any mistake anymore in the relation by checking a DataObject already linked with another of the
parent class.

See [ComplexTableField](ComplexTableField) for more documentation on the base-class.

## Construction

It works exactly in the same way than [ComplexTableField](ComplexTableField) :

	:::php
	$tablefield = new HasManyComplexTableField(
	    $this,
	    'MyFruits',
	    'Fruit',
	    array(
		'Name' => 'Name',
		'Color' => 'Color'
	    ),
	    'getCMSFields_forPopup'
	);


**Notice** : You still have different ways to customize the popup window as in the parent-class
[ComplexTableField](ComplexTableField).

## Customizing The Add Title

You can change the add title value by using this code :

	:::php
	$tablefield->setAddTitle( 'A Fruit' );
