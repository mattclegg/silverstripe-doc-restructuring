# Upgrading 2.4.4

## Changelogs

## Upgrading Notes

### If you're using open_basedir in PHP:

There is a bug in 2.4.4 which breaks open_basedir restriction.

The issue has been fixed in the development 2.4 branch, but you'll need to patch your existing copy of SilverStripe
2.4.4 if this affects you. The error usually occurs when you try logging into the CMS.

It can be fixed by patching your working copy with this change: http://open.silverstripe.org/changeset/115314

###  Security: SQL information disclosure in MySQLDatabase  

#### Description

The 'showqueries' GET parameter shows all performed SQL queries in the page output.
This is intended functionality, but should be limited websites not being in "live mode"
(set through Director::set_environment_type(), checked through Director::isLive()).
By adding an 'ajax' GET parameter you can circumvent this live check.

See Secunia Advisory: http://secunia.com/advisories/42346/

#### Solution

Don't circumvent Director::isLive() check in MySQLDatabase

#### Impact

Information disclosure of potentially sensitive information through SQL query strings.

### Security: XSS in controller handling for missing actions

#### Description

Controller routing in SilverStripe core doesn't encode
error messages for missing URL actions before returning
them to the user (see Controller->handleAction()).

This can be reproduced with any URL that doesn't
have custom error handling defined through RequestHandler::$url_handlers,
which includes all core controllers.

Reproduce with the following URL:
`http://`<your-host>`/Security/%3Cvideo%20src=1%20onerror=%22alert%281%29%22%3E;;`

See Secunia Advisory: http://secunia.com/advisories/42346/

#### Solution

Force Content-Type: text/plain upon output.

#### Impact

Attackers can craft URLs to change the displayed website behaviour
as well as gain access to authenticated cookie information.
In case the victim has a permanent login cookie ("Remember me" checkbox),
this can lead to CMS access for attackers.

### Security: SQL injection with Translatable extension enabled

#### Description

Locale setter methods on i18n and Translatable classes are not sanitizing or whitelisting input,
which can lead to SQL injection based on "locale" GET parameters. This behaviour
is limited to websites having the (built-in) Translatable extension activated.

#### Solution

Sanitize locale values in Translatable->augmentSQL() and whitelist
locale values in i18n setters.

#### Impact

High

####  Affected Versions


*  SilverStripe trunk

*  SilverStripe 2.4.3 or older

### Security: Version number information disclosure

SilverStripe exposes version information through
static files located in the webroot. As these files
have no extension, they are served without processing
by most webserver default configurations.

The files are:
sapphire/silverstripe_version
cms/silverstripe_version

See http://open.silverstripe.org/ticket/5031
See http://secunia.com/advisories/42346/

#### Solution

Reject web requests to version information through .htaccess for Apache, and web.config for IIS.

#### Impact

Version Information about the product can be used to craft attacks more specifically.

### Security: Weak entropy in tokens for CSRF protection, autologin, "forgot password" emails and password salts

SilverStripe uses rand(), mt_rand() in combination with
uniqid(), substr() and time() to create pseudo-random tokens.
Due to the nature of these implementations, the entropy
of tokens is low, potentially exposing them to brute force attacks.

Affected functionality:


*  CSRF form protection

*  Member Autologin

*  "Forgot Password" emails

*  Autogenerated salt values for hashed passwords in the Member table

#### Solution

Use the best available PRNG implementation on the current platform
and PHP version (favouring MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM and openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()).

#### Impact

Weak entropy can be used for more successful brute force attacks.

### Security: HTTP referer leakage on Security/changepassword

#### Description

The Security/changepassword URL action can be invoked with a temporary
token stored against the member record ("AutoLoginHash"). This token is set
when a member requests a new password by email through Security/lostpassword,
and cleared upon successful password change.

The token is passed as a GET parameter, which can expose it to HTTP referer
leakage, in case the member decides to navigate away from the "change password" form
before submitting the form (which would invalidate the token). 
If the clicked link is an external page, the (still valid) GET parameter will appear
in the external site's HTTP referer logs, enabling third parties to take over
user accounts.

Note: This is only a problem when Security/changepassword is used without being logged-in.

#### Solution

Redirect from Security/changepassword/?h=XXX to Security/changepassword
and store the token in session instead.

#### Impact

Takeover of user accounts by third parties with access to HTTP referer logs.

### Security: CSRF protection bypassed when handling form action requests through controller

#### Description

The built-in CSRF protection on forms in SilverStripe can be bypassed
by routing the action through the controller instead of the form.

Protected: mycontroller/MyForm/?action_doSubmit=1

Unprotected: mycontroller/action_doSubmit

Note: Does not apply to manual CSRF protection in controller actions
through SecurityToken->check().

#### Solution

Developers are encouraged to use Controller::$allowed_actions to limit the
actions accessible through URL routing. Methods that need automatic CSRF
protection (most form actions) should NOT be included in $allowed_actions,
their protection is handled through request handling in the form class itself.

See [security](security#limiting_url-access_to_controller_methods) documentation for more details.

#### Impact

Exposes various administrative actions (creating a new page, reverting to draft)
to CSRF attacks, in case attackers know the URL a victim has a valid CMS login for.
