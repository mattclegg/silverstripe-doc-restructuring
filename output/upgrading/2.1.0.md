# Upgrading to SilverStripe 2.1.0

#### Changelog

See [full changelog](http://open.silverstripe.com/wiki/ChangeLog/2.1.0)

#### General

##### Too many redirects

A problem occurs of 'too many redirects' or the page just doesn't load (home page) because of these situations:

   * Access tab for home page has 'logged in users only', OR
   * NO radio buttons have been set. This happens when upgrading site from old DB.

It's caused by a redirect to Security/login on the home page controller, which is blocked off, so you can't actually
login, so it infinitely loops a redirect. See http://open.silverstripe.com/ticket/1488
