# Introduction

The class *Page* should always be a direct subclass of [SiteTree](http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/cms/SiteTree.html),
and is the starting point for any customizations for your site.

**Page.php/Page.ss are NOT included in the Silverstripe-distribution, you need to create them yourself**
