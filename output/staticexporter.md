## Introduction

This class lets you export a static copy of your site as a tar.gz archive.

See [StaticPublisher](StaticPublisher) for a more versatile solution for deploying static content (incl. publishing to
multiple content servers).
## Requirements

*  Unix-Environment (does not work on Windows)

## Usage

Usage through URL:

	
	http://localhost/StaticExporter/export


Usage on commandline (through [sake](sake)) is not possible at the moment, as we're sending a file to the browser for
download.

Specify a custom baseurl in case you want to deploy the static HTML pages on a different host:

	
	http://localhost/StaticExporter/export?baseurl=http://example.com
