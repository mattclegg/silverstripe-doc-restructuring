===== Example use =====
If you want to implement a [[CheckboxSetField]] into a form element, you need to pass it an array of source data.

<code php>
new CheckboxSetField(
   $name = "topics",
   $title = "I am interested in the following topics",
   $source = array(
      "1" => "Technology",
      "2" => "Gardening",
      "3" => "Cooking",
      "4" => "Sports"
   ),
   $value = "1"
)
</code>

===== Data connectivity =====
The checkbox set field will save its data in one of ways:

  * If the field name matches a many-many join on the object being edited, that many-many join will be updated to link to the objects selected on the checkboxes.  In this case, the keys of your value map should be the IDs of the database records.
  * If the field name matches a database field, a comma-separated list of values will be saved to that field.  The keys can be text or numbers.
