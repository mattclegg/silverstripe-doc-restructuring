== 2.3.2 Changelog ==

== 2.3.2-rc4 ==

=== Bugfixes ===
 * ![79278] Fixed !TranslatableTest->testSavePageInCMS(), needed admin login to edit !ViewersGroups field (Merged via: r79282)
 * ![79269] Excluding Access fields on !SiteTree from Translatable->updateCMSFields(), as their original values break the javascript logic for showing/hiding the fields (Merged via: r79282)
 * ![79266] Passing locale through to !TreeSelectorField ajax calls (Merged via: r79282)
 * ![79240] Marking new !TreeMultiSelectField_Readonly with $readonly flag, otherwise breaks CMS saving with Translable enabled etc. (see #4240)

== 2.3.2-rc3 ==

=== Enhancement ===
 * ![78919] DevelopmentAdmin: Changed dev/build to produce nicer formatting when running from sake/dev/build CLI
 * ![78618] Add HTMLText#!FirstSentence based on new HTMLText#Summary

=== API Change ===
 * ![78632] Added increase_memory_limit_to() for increasing but not decreasing memory limit.
 * ![78618] Added two arguments to HTMLText#Summary. Minimal impact since previously any usage of this function threw an error.

=== Bugfixes ===
 * ![79208] Don't remove translation groups in Translatable->onBeforeDelete() if the decorated record uses Versioned, as other representations of the record might still exist in other tables (e.g. !SiteTree_Live) (see #4219) (Merged via: r79211)
 * ![79194] Writing Locale in Translatable->onBeforeWrite() regardless of the record ID existing (see #4232). This is more in line with Translatable->requireDefaultRecords() which automatically updates all NULL locale values anyway. (Merged via: r79195)
 * ![78920] DevelopmentAdmin: Don't allow dev/reset to be run from CLI, as this could be accidentally run - give a message that the user should run this from their web browser instead
 * ![78732] #4119: Fixed encoding of readonly !TextareaFields and unicode in !TextareaFields.
 * ![78729] Fixed Translatable->requireDefaultRecords() for non-!SiteTree objects (was assuming Versioned to be present) (Merged via: r79195)

 * ![78542] Don't allow the use of get-var ?isDev=1 when security DB isn't available.
 * ![78496] WidgetAreaEditor shouldn't ever call editable segment "!NoWidgets" - this is just a placeholder
 * ![78471] Fixed readonly version of !TreeMultiselectField
 * ![78470] Get backtrace rather than crazy context stuff shown in dev error messages
 * ![78469] Fix readonly versions of grant fields.
 * ![78452] fixed spelling of spam protector
 * ![78352] modified convertDataObjectWithoutHeader to handle empty relationships.
 * ![78256] Removing operating system limitations for Flash Player checks which determine showing/hiding of upload button (which currently requires exactly FP9 in our version of SWFUpload). See #3679 and #3023 for followup tickets.
 * ![78155] Changing from unset record entry to an empty value shouldn't register as a 'level 2' change
 * ![78118] Using language dropdown to determine locale for partial tree ajax loads, because we can't rely on a page with a hidden "Locale" field being loaded in the CMS. Fixed bug with wrong spelling of "locale" argument. (see #3995). (Merged via: r78119)
 * ![76517] Closing <link type="alternate"> tags for XHTML compliance on Translatable->!MetaTags(). Use !ContentNegotiator to transform them back to HTML markup. See #3989 (Merged via: r78167)

 * ![77727] #4119 netminds: Fix error page publication for lang to locate replacement.
 * ![77726] a redirection with an external link that has more than one query string variables. Do not convert the link to html entities

 * ![76666] Made batch actions pluggable through CMSBatchActionHandler::register()

 * ![70325] Altering parent getCMSFields() results in !RedirectorPage instead of starting with an empty !FieldSet, as this discards any tabs and fields which are not explicitly mentioned in the implementation like the ability to create a translation. (Merged via: r76515)
 * ![70306] Don't require a record to be written (through exists()) when checking Translatable->isTranslation() or Translatable->hasTranslation()

== Beta 1 - since 2.3.1 ==

=== New Features ===
 * ![75153] Allow Title and Navigation Label to be searched separately
 * ![74739] hooks into form field to allow custom error messages. Note does not currently apply to the behaviour / js. Just the PHP validation

 * ![74327] added $Var.!UpperCase support to DBField

 * ![73670] added after uploading notify method
 * ![70327] Enabled specifying a language through a hidden field in !SearchForm which limits the search to pages in this language (incl. unit tests) (Merged via: r74986)


=== API Change ===
 * ![75913] Deprecated !ModelAsController->get404Page() with using the URLSegment "404" on a normal page type - please use the !ErrorPage class instead (Merged via: r75916)
 * ![75742] Deprecated Translatable::get_langs_by_id() - use getTranslations()
 * ![75328] Deprecated Translatable::get_homepage_urlsegment_by_language(), use get_homepage_urlsegment_by_locale() (Merged via: r75685)
 * ![74969] Deprecated !DataObjectSet->toDropDownMap() and made it an alias of map(), copying the functionality of toDropDownMap() into map()
 * ![74901] add documentation to changeset r74858.
 * ![74858] BulkLoader::getImportSpec() call !DataObject::fieldLables() with $includerelations as false, so that the relations is separated from column fields

 * ![73951] Removed Translatable::creating_from() - doesn't apply any longer
 * ![73900] Deprecated Object->extInstance(), use getExtensionInstance() instead
 * ![73468] Removed Translatable::get_original() - with the new "translation groups" concept there no longer is an original for a translation
 * ![73466] Deprecated Translatable::set_default_lang(), Translatable::default_lang() (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73345] Removed CMSMain->switchlanguage() - createTranslation() is sufficient for new, ajax refreshing of CMS state got way too complicated for switching languages, we now just reload the entire CMS with a different ?lang GET parameter (Merged via: r74988)
 * ![73338] Translatable->findOriginalIDs(), Translatable->setOriginalPage(), Translatable->getOriginalPage()
 * ![70307] Removed CMSMain->switchlanguage() (Merged via: r74988)

=== Bugfixes ===
 * ![76036] Fixed extraFilter argument for !SiteTree::get_by_url() when translatable is enabled
 * ![76019] Unblock blocked requirements when opening a poppup - otherwise
 * ![75984] Removing !ParentType and ParentID fields in Translatable->updateCMSFields() as they are causing js problems when set to readonly.

 * ![75983] Removed URLSegment detection from Translatable->onBeforeWrite() - it was always preceeded by !SiteTree->onBeforeWrite() which already alters the URL, so the appending of locale values to disambiguate the URL was pointless (never triggered) (Merged via: r76035)
 * ![75936] Resetting default language in !TranslatableTest - this was breaking !VirtualPageTest before (Merged via: r75937)
 * ![75926] Fixed undefined var error in !VirtualPage (Merged via: r75937)

 * ![75869] #3970: Make virtual page editing work.
 * ![75831] Checking for existing value on !TreeDropdownField->performReadonlyTransformation() - this broke the !ReadonlyTransformation on Translatable->updateCMSFields() for the new "ParentID" field in !SiteTree->getCMSFields()
 * ![75826] Removing the appended querying for NULL or empty Locale values in Translatable->augmentSQL() - this should no longer be necessary as we set default locales to all records through Translatable->requireDefaultRecords() (Merged via: r75838)
 * ![75791] Fixed !ErrorPage::get_filepath_for_errorcode() to work with locale values instead of short language subtags (Merged via: r75838)
 * ![75787] Fixed faulty regex that broke rewritten links to be relative to the base href
 * ![75785] set when ajax is disabled for commenting that we redirect manually down to the comment form
 * ![75782] Unified locale values between i18n::$all_locales and $common_locales - the common locales should be a subset of all locales, without any additional ones as this might cause side-effects with !LanguageDropdownField (see #3958) (Merged via: r75783)
 * ![75745] Fixed DBLocaleTest (Merged via: r75746)
 * ![75743] #3959: Fixed auto-setting has many relations on CTF - works mostly like the many-many relation auto setting.

 * ![75705] Fixed right hand image add/edit form panel sizing

 * ![75654] Fixed !PageCommentInterface $this->class being NULL because parent::__construct() wasn't called
 * ![75614] Fixed refactoring of getRecord() so that it can handle currentPage() calls properly.
 * ![75611] Let CMS users open pages deleted from draft; bug introduced by translatable.
 * ![75585] Updated !DataObjectSet::map() to use empty string, rather than 0, as the empty value
 * ![75328] Updated enabling mechanism in Translatable->alternateGetByUrl()
 * ![75270] #3740: Fixd duplicate tab highlight in !ModelAdmin, by moving back to old tabstrip.js
 * ![75269] #3740: Make tabstrip.js less picky about the URL before the # link
 * ![75263] Fixed HTTPRequest::send_file() to actually output the response, whereas before it did nothing
 * ![75258] Fixed HTTPRequest::send_file() to send the file properly over SSL with Internet Explorer. Without the pragma header, it won't work
 * ![75249] Correctly showing the available languages dropdown in Translatable->getCMSFields() (Merged via: r75685)
 * ![75248] Only force !DataObject->forceChange() on fields which aren't already marked as changed (Merged via: r75685)

 * ![75182] Make sure tabs resize correctly when they are loaded

 * ![75156] Setting Classname and !RecordClassname properties on internal $record map when constructing a !DataObject without passing $record into it. This ensures that getChangedFields() works on !ClassName as well, which is required for Translatable->onBeforeWrite() (Merged via: r75685)
 * ![75151] #3919: Fix !DataObject::dbObject() for decorated fields (Merged from r75150)
 * ![75150] #3919: Fix !DataObject::dbObject() for decorated fields (Merged via: r75151)
 * ![75126] Fixed incorrect spelling of "$this" variable
 * ![75125] Fixed CSVParser constructor not passing the arguments to the protected variables delimiter and enclosure

 * ![75113] Fixed image editing panel padding in CMS "Insert image" button being squashed
 * ![75096] Allow execution of actions (such as Page's search) on !ErrorPage; limit the 404 display to the index() action
 * ![75095] Use rendered page for 404 pages
 * ![75049] Ensure that !CheckboxField always returns 1 from the form request data instead of "on" - this was because the value attribute didn't exist on the <input> tag
 * ![75046] Make sure that !CheckboxField sets it's value as either 1 or 0, so that saveInto() saves the proper boolean value
 * ![75045] Ensure that !CheckboxField setValue() always sets it's value as either 1 or 0, even though the request data can come through as "on"
 * ![75039] Fixed case where logging in with a session member ID that didn't exist in the database stopped you from being able to "Log in as someone else"
 * ![75038] #3594: Made WYSIWYG editor 50% larger
 * ![75034] Select correct default data formatter in restfulserver when there's an apparently useful Accept header that doesn't actually match a data formatter{
 * ![75032] Fixed "Log in as someone else" action failure when submitting !MemberLoginForm while logged in
 * ![75030] when load a new Page (or other type of form in !DataAdmin or !GenericAdmin), initTabstripe called additional time for every tabstrip on the page
 * ![75023] Fixed error if clicking the root of a sitetree in the CMS - affected the !AssetAdmin and !SecurityAdmin sections
 * ![74981] Member::inGroup() returns false instead of an error if group doesn't exist. Ticket #3813 - thanks bgribaudo!

 * ![74978] Fixed spelling mistake of "getOrientation" method name on Image
 * ![74961] Fixed error if JS/CSS requirements have arguments. Ticket #3860. Thanks simon_w!

 * ![74927] Clearing Requirements in !ScaffoldingComplexTableField, and fixed constructor arguments

 * ![74919] Moving Requirements for !TableField, !TableListField, !ComplexTableField, !ScaffoldComplexTableField and !HasManyComplexTableField from __construct() into !FieldHolder() and renderWith(), which means inclusion closer to render time, and less side-effects by a previous Requirements::clear(), e.g. in a CTF popup
 * ![74904] Removed unnecessary requirements from !ComplexTableField_Popup: !LeftAndMain.js, !LeftAndMain_right.js, !TableField.js, !ComplexTableField.js - they will be included by the fields if necessary
 * ![74902] Making sure all input fields inside a newly added !TableField row have unique HTML ids. This was causing problems when javascript logic was acting on those (previously ambiguous fields), e.g. when trying to use a jQuery UI datepicker
 * ![74899] If validator doesn't exist on Form, don't attempt to call setForm() on it or you'll get a non-object error
 * ![74879] Removed additional $ sign that isn't supposed to be there that broke !GroupTest
 * ![74725] Fixing !CurrencyField serverside and javascript validation to accept numbers with leading or trailing spaces

 * ![74071] Fixed Form_!EditForm_Locale reference in !LeftAndMain_right.js (used to be Form_!EditForm_Lang) (Merged via: r74988)
 * ![74069] Fixed legacy handling of Translatable::enable(),Translatable::disable() and Translatable::is_enabled() - applying extension to !SiteTree instead of Page to avoid datamodel clashes (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![74065] Re-added Translatable->isTranslation() for more friendly deprecation (originally removed in r73338) (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73900] Unsetting all cached singletons in Object::remove_extension() to avoid outdated extension_instances
 * ![73883] Making $_SINGLETONS a global instead of a static in Core.php so it can be re-used in other places (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73836] Removed version number from <meta> generator tag - opt for security by obscurity in this case (originally committed in r70422 and r71172) (Merged via: r73837)

 * ![73468] Updated !MigrateTranslatableTask to new Locale based datamodel (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73465] Fixed Hierarchy->Children() testing in !TranslatableTest - with the new datamodel you can't call Children() in a different language regardless of Translatable::set_reading_lang(), the Children() call has to be made from a parent in the same language (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73344] Checking for existence of original before trying to get translation in !LeftAndMain->currentPage() (Merged via: r74988)
 * ![73343] Changed CSS selector for !TranslationTab javascript behaviour to be less specific (Merged via: r74988)
 * ![73342] Removed link to "original page" for a translation - no longer valid
 * ![73341] Disabled auto-excluding of default language from the "available languages" array in !LanguageDropdownField - due to the new "translation groups" its possible to have a translation from another language into the default language (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73339] Disabled "untranslated" CSS class for !SiteTree elements - doesn't apply any longer with the new "translation groups" concept (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73338] Removed bypass in Translatable->!AllChildrenIncludingDeleted() (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73059] Make object cache testing more robust (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![72054] Fixed finding a translated homepage without an explicit URLSegment (e.g. http://mysite.com/?lang=de) - see #3540
 * ![71340] Including Hierarchy->children in flushCache() and renamed to _cache_children. This caused problems in !TranslatableTest when re-using the same !SiteTree->Children() method with different languages on the same object (even with calling flushCache() inbetween the calls) (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![71297] Only show the !LangSelector dropdown if there's multiple languages available on the site (Merged via: r74988)
 * ![71258] Fix translatable being enabled when it shouldn't be (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![70324] Making sure that !LeftAndMain->!CurrentPage() respects language settings - was returning pages in different language from session after switching between languages in cms (Merged via: r74988)

 * ![70322] Ensuring that new pages can't be created when in translation mode by disabling the "create..." tree action (Merged via: r74988)
 * ![70318] Reverted special cases for Translatable in Versioned->canBeVersioned() (originally committed in r42119) - was checking for existence of underscores in table names as an indication of the "_lang" suffix, which is no longer needed. It was also a flawed assumption which tripped over classes like !TranslatableTest_!TestPage (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![70306] Don't require a record to be written (through exists()) when checking Translatable->isTranslation() or Translatable->hasTranslation()
 * ![70214] Falling back to Translatable::current_lang() if no $context object is given, in augmentAllChildrenIncludingDeleted() and !AllChildrenIncludingDeleted()
 * ![70138] Disabled assumption that SQLQuery->filtersOnID() should only kick in when exactly one WHERE clause is given - this is very fragile and hard to test. It would return TRUE on $where = "!SiteTree.ID = 5", but not on $where = array("Lang = 'de'", "!SiteTree.ID = 5") (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![70080] Fix translatable migration not writing records to Live properly (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![69959] Temporarily disabled cookie/session selection in Translatable::choose_site_lang() until we have a good test suite for the side effects.
 * ![60171] Improved !DataObject::get_one to avoid PHP segfaults (Merged via: r74986)

 * ![74489] add the ability that a !SimpleImageField could be disabled.
 * ![74017] Improved deprecated fallbacks in Translatable by auto-converting short language codes to long locales and vice versa through i18n::get_lang_from_locale()/i18n::get_locale_from_lang() (Merged via: r74986)
 * ![73951] Translatable extension is no longer hooked up to !SiteTree by default, which should improve performance and memory usage for sites not using Translatable. Please use Object::add_extension('!SiteTree','Translatable') in your _config.php instead. Adjusted several classes (Image, !ErrorPage, !RootURLController) to the new behaviour. (Merged via: r74986)

 * ![72367] Using IETF/HTTP compatible "long" language code in !SiteTree->!MetaTags(). This means the default <meta type="content-language..."> value will be "en-US" instead of "en". The locale can be either set through the Translatable content language, or through i18n::set_locale() (Merged via: r74986)
