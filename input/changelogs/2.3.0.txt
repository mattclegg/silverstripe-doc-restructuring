=== API Change ===
 * ![70697] add Group::canView() so that give group object a different level of security control.

By default a new !RequiredField instance is used without any fields marked as required.

One example are file extension checks in !FileField subclasses.

 * ![69899] Explicitly setting "lang" as a GET var when getting a page within the CMS (if the language chooser DOM object is available, hence translation mode is enabled). Used in CMSMain->init() to set the "current language". (merged from branches/translatable in r64523, thanks wakeless!)
 * ![69894] Using baseDataClass() in Translatable::get_existing_content_languages()
 * ![69893] Added extension point for augmentAllChildrenIncludingDeleted(), augmentNumChildrenCountQuery(), augmentStageChildren() in Hierarchy (merged from branches/translatable in r64523, thanks wakeless!)

 * ![69879] Fixed label positioning in !CompositeFields for original language fields in translation mode (was shifted left before)
 * ![69878] Fixed $add_action behaviour for !SiteTree classes (through i18n_singular_name() method). Deprecated in favour of "<myclassname>.TITLE" entity to enable localized page titles. Limited add_action behaviour to !SiteTree (was implemented on !DataObject before)

 * ![69828] Fixed styling for caption checkbox field on the right hand image panel in CMSMain
 * ![69803] If !TreeDropdownField source object is "Folder", don't show "File" tree items unless the marking filter function is explicitly set. This fixes the bug where files were appearing for selecting a folder in the thumbnailstrip field in CMS
 * ![69752] somtimes +/- icons hidden. ticket #893
 * ![69728] #3254 - Fixed fatal errors when creating subclass of member

 * ![69694] #3097: Removed buggy template feature
 * ![69693] #3249: Allow altering of encryption algorithm
 * ![69690] #3081 simon_w: Fixed pagination on spam comments
 * ![69689] Don't include Validator.js if Validator->javascriptValidationHandler is set to 'none' (in Validator::__construct()).
 * ![69681] Fixed HTML insertion through TinyMCE in Safari - !TextArea fallback for lacking Codepress-support wasn't working. Known bug in Codepress JS Highlighter, see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1913725&group_id=186981&atid=919470
 * ![69657] Fixed js error due to inlined inclusion of CMSMain_upload.js which was conflicting with inline initialization. Disabled initializiation as the flash uploader was pulled out a while ago anyway (see #3251)
 * ![69504] Fixed !SiteTreeHandlers.loadTree_url url concatenation
 * ![69442] Fixed permissions in CMSMain->revert() - only needs edit permissions, not publish permissions
 * ![69378] CountryDropdownField now allows for title to be optional, which uses the name of the field if not set. This makes it consistent with !DropdownField
 * ![69377] Added check before foreach() to fix potential HMCTF bugs
 * ![69360] Get !DrodpownField::$emptyString working when used with a SQLMap source
 * ![69321] Added <td class="action"> to !AssetTableField.ss to comply with template semantics of parent classes (necessary to detect javascript actions)
 * ![69222] Strip potential whitespace from the beginning and end of string before limiting word count in Text->!LimitWordCount(), fixing potential interference with truncation process
 * ![69220] Fixed Text->!LimitWordCount() not returning the correct number of words in the truncated text.
 * ![69204] Making Password formfield in Member->getCMSFields() translatable
 * ![69203] Making "Main" tab in !FormScaffolder translatable
 * ![69065] Fixed notice-level error in no-get-var URL processing when there is no querystring.
 * ![68999] Make sure the website URL that the commenter posts has a correct "http://" or "http://" bit at the start of the string
 * ![68940] Fixed bug in SQLQuery::unlimitedRowCount() when used with grouped queries, that should fix a lot of pagination situations.
 * ![68935] Fixed PHP notice potential error in !MemberTableField->addtogroup()
 * ![68921] Turned english text into translatable entity for !PageCommentInterface link for RSS feed of all comments for all pages
 * ![68890] "console not defined" error in IE in en_US.js, check typeof(console) is not undefined before calling console.error()
 * ![68881] remove Debug::message
 * ![68875] Fix uglyness when title is longer than the tree dropdown field
 * ![68858] Added closing tags to relation XML in XMLDataFormatter. Was relying on !ContentNegotiator fixing self-closing tags automatically, but this form of content parsing is disabled for xml content by default now (see r68484)
 * ![68834] Make sure date is a string before trying to use strtotime
 * ![68817] Fixed sprintf detection bug in !SiteTree->getClassDropdown()
 * ![68810] Making only formfields readonly (not formactions) when comparing versions and showing historical versions within CMSMain
 * ![68809] Check hasChanged method exists before calling it
 * ![68764] Fixed translation of !CommentAdmin_!SiteTree.ss
 * ![68762] Fixed label spacing in Date->!TimeDiff()
 * ![68757] Fixed additional tabs for image popus in !AssetTableField. They we're not being generated in non-english interfaces due to the translated title being used as the tab identifier
 * ![68754] Limiting readonly transformation of form in CMSMain->!EditForm() to fields only (excluding actions). !FormAction readonly transformations were fixed a while ago, which meant that they were actually enforced now, causing unavailable cms actions in certain scenarios (e.g. with a page deleted from live, which should make the fields readonly, but leave buttons functional)
 * ![68752] Fixed !TranslatableTest to instanciate Page instead of !SiteTree fixtures - pages in the database should never have !ClassName=!SiteTree. This was causing failing tests due to the changes in !SiteTree->getClassDropdown()
 * ![68751] Including all translated language tables by default in i18n::_t() instead of selectively including modules based on filename. This caused bugs where entities were located in language tables in a different module than their filepath would suggest. Example: Page.SINGULARNAME is stored in sapphire/lang/en_US.php, while Page.php is stored in mysite/Page.php
 * ![68746] Don't overwrite existing module arrays in i18nTextcollector - fixing bug with entities for "foreign modules" being reset during parsing

 * ![68662] #3166 jam13: Fixed caching in !RestfulService

 * ![68331] Fixed !ModelAdmin import success message (too few arguments for sprintf())
 * ![68194] Allowing !FormAction instances to be readonly by setting disabled="disabled". Adding CSS class "disabled".
 * ![68177] Moved creation of "help" menu entry from cms/_config.php to !LeftAndMain::init() to get localized titles (locale isn't set at _config.php level)
 * ![68176] Fixed i18n display of menu titles rendered by CMSMenu in !LeftAndMain->!MainMenu()
 * ![68170] Escape table name in versioned to allow creation of page type classes with the same names as SQL reserved words
 * ![68159] Changing i18n entity format in CMSMenu->provideI18nEntities() to have actual class as namespace (related: r66264)
 * ![68155] Added stub PDODatabase->renameField() implementation to avoid errors when batch-instanciating singletons
 * ![68130] Supporting URLs with folder-structure in "sake -start <myprocessname> <myurl>"
 * ![68039] Improved !DataObjectSet->!PaginationSummary() to show full context (instead of halved) when on first or last page
 * ![68027] Don't show template comments in RSSFeed, or it'll break the XML document
 * ![68026] Fixed undefined variable $matches in SSViewer::parseTemplateContent()
 * ![68024] SSViewer::set_source_file_comments(false) wasn't working because of lack of checking if enabled.
 * ![67777] Added check ot i18n::include_by_class() to prevent repeated calls.
 * ![67681] Add a unique identifier to the "direction" method for Email::obfuscate() to avoid duplicate custom CSS being included in the page header
 * ![67678] Method not found error. Requirements::customCSS() should be calling self::backend()->customCSS() not custom()
 * ![67609] #3182 - Fix URL fixing on machines where url is case insensitive (hamish)
 * ![67605] #3204 - Broken link tracking is broken (ajshort)
 * ![67587] #3174 - Unable to drop widgets into widget areas in CMS (marcink)
 * ![67584] #3218 - Spelling mistake in !RestfulService (hamish)
 * ![67582] Fixed a check for CSV field formatting.
 * ![67580] Fixed an aliasing problem when saving popup items, and a bug with when associating a new record with the parent ID associated with the field.
 * ![67530] SSDatetime can handle being given a NZ date in dd/mm/yyyy format
 * ![67529] Only setting !LockedOutUntil to NULL in Member->logIn() if the column is actually present in the database. Otherwise this setting will case an UPDATE Member SQL query to fail on the first /dev/build call on a 2.2->2.3 upgrade if not in dev-mode (=requiring login) (see #3171)
 * ![67526] Added $!CurrentLink to templates of !AssetTableField and !MemberTableField in order to support auto-refreshing after popup-close (see #2925)
 * ![67520] Fixed i18n::get_owner_module() to detect template paths in themes (array notation) correctly (see #3022)
 * ![67519] Added !GoogleSitemap.ss from sapphire
 * ![67506] Avoid ugly border in CMS forms by adding "border: none" in CSS to cms/css/layout.css
 * ![67503] disabling template comments for xml output like sitemap.xml
 * ![67455] Fixed incorrect parameter variable name in Mailer->sendPlain()
 * ![67417] Added <legend> element immediately after <fieldset> for !SearchForm and Form templates. This is required to validate these templates as W3C compliant
 * ![67401] Moving Requirements::combine_files() calls from cms/_config.php to !LeftAndMain->init() to avoid side-effects in non-CMS contexts. Examples:
 * ![67363] $allowHTML argument was not passed to !DatalessField::__construct
 * ![67304] Since !ModelAsController->handleRequest() expects a URLSegment, we make the !ErrorPage Link() return a relative URLSegment in !ErrorPage->publish()
 * ![67299] Changed Director::test($this->URLSegment) to Director::test($this->Link()) in !ErrorPage->publish() to be more robust
 * ![67290] Added parent::setUp() and parent::tearDown() calls to various tests, in preparation for push/pop a mock controller the controller-stack
 * ![67271] dev/build should function even when new classes are referenced in _config.php
 * ![67268] Filter on the baseclassid in Hierachy, not the class id, in case the class doesnt have a table (aoneil)
 * ![67221] Save default locale for new members, so the profile form doesn't show first available locale in dropdown because its defaults are overwritten by Member->Locale = NULL (see #3159)
 * ![67201] Declared behaviour.js variables as local for better recursive functionality
 * ![67199] Fixed incorrect permission checking when the current member isn't being used
 * ![67162] Scrollbars didn't appear properly in CMS without resizing the window manually, so used jQuery to properly detect when document is ready before attempting resize. Ticket #3089
 * ![67150] Checking for "$this instanceof !VirtualPage" instead of "$this->class == '!VirtualPage' to support subclassing in !VirtualPage->onBeforeWrite()
 * ![67147] Fix requirements not being restored after an email is sent
 * ![67140] Checking for existence of $this->record in !VirtualPage_Controller->init()
 * ![67137] Fix publishing of error pages
 * ![67083] Fixed !StaticExporter output format

 * ![67045] Fixed Enum::scaffoldSearchForm() to always include an (All) option
 * ![67035] Fixed error in javascript (because of commented out code) that broke IE6/7 in the CMS
 * ![66946] Fixing tests
 * ![66940] Fixed warning on !AssetAdmin (merged from trunk)
 * ![66922] #3100: Graceful degradation for codepress in safari
 * ![66918] #3115 ajshort: Fixed backslashes in temp folder location in manifest builder
 * ![66894] Friendlier error when you have a site running on a PHP4 server, or a server without PHP.
 * ![66891] Don't make blank dates show 1/1/1970
 * ![66888] Better generation of !PastMember cookie when you have stale login info
 * ![66828] Fixed sortWidgets() function in !WidgetAreaEditor not working because it was picking up comment nodes
 * ![66820] Added extension to email address when accessing Security/passwordsent since the . (dots) are split into extensions when the URL is parsed
 * ![66799] Fixed importer not working because of i18n_singular_name(), just use the class name of the model instead
 * ![66793] Made use of Convert::raw2att() before returning the !ModelName for Import spec fields
 * ![66791] Fixed "Show specification..." link not working because !ModelName had spaces in it
 * ![66784] Only including !ModelAdmin->!ImportForm() if an actual importer was specified
 * ![66740] Passing through $member param from !SiteTree->canPublish() to !SiteTree->canEdit()
 * ![66723] fixed typo in filesystem
 * ![66707] Fixed notice-level errors in !PhoneNumberField
 * ![66701] Add !LeftAndMain:$url_rule to minimise bugs in modules
 * ![66698] Fixed sake bug when checking for an argument in bash script. Ticket #3112. Thanks simon_w.
 * ![66638] Fixed flaw logic checking for $member variable, since it's always set the alternative for choosing Member::currentUser() would never work.
 * ![66635] Fixed !SiteTree->getCMSActions() so it returns a !FieldSet, instead of a !DataObjectSet. This makes it consistent with !DataObject->getCMSActions() as well as !SiteTree->getCMSFields()
 * ![66632] Fixed !SiteTree->getCMSActions() not extending properly because it was passing an array to the extend() 2nd argument, which expected a !FieldSet object
 * ![66629] Fixed incorrect class name in user_error message for deprecated function HTTP::sendFileToBrowser()
 * ![66608] ModelAdmin clear search now preserves the result column selection
 * ![66505] Consistenly returning cloned instances for all !FormField classes when calling performReadonlyTransformation() or performDisabledTransformation(). Making sure that these instances are actually flagged as readyonly/disabled. Addd unit tests to dynamically instanciate most !FormField classes to check for this behaviour. Originally, this bugfix was necessary to avoid changed !FormField state when recursively calling replaceField() on !FieldSet->dataFields() in Translatable->updateCMSFields()
 * ![66431] Removed !SearchForm->!FormMethod() and used $this->setFormMethod() in !SearchForm constructor instead which is a nicer solution instead of overloading a Form method
 * ![66334] Hiding "change password" fields by default in admin/myprofile, they shouldn't validate the input by default. Replaced with a link to toggle those fields (#3106)
 * ![66332] Include jquery_improvements.js whenever jquery.js is required, so jQuery.noConflict() is set. This is required to ensure $() behaves in the prototypey way (alias for document.getElementByID()) rather than jQuery style (document.getElementsBySelector())
 * ![66331] Removed overloaded $() function which added support for multiple string arguments in behaviour.js - was conflicting with argument usage in jQuery when not in noConflict() mode. As far as i can tell, multiple string arguments in $() were never used anyway.
 * ![66319] Removed dependency on !ComplexTableField JS in !LeftAndMain for "My Profile" popup
 * ![66318] Check if $member variable isn't empty before looking for first name in !MemberLoginForm
 * ![66317] Fixed call to incorrect case of function name, Member::currentUser() should be used
 * ![66313] Fixed !ForeignKey->scaffoldFormField() usage of model class instead of relation class to generate dropdown list
 * ![66309] Fixed far too small height and width of "Profile" popup in CMS, popupHeight and popupWidth should be defaultPopupHeight and defaultPopupWidth instead according to the !ComplexTableField prototype
 * ![66306] Fixed !HasManyComplexTableField, and subclass fields !HasOneComplexTableField and !ManyManyComplexTableField saving bug because javascript wasn't being included properly
 * ![66305] Fixed recursion bug with !FieldSet::fieldPosition
 * ![66274] Improved reliability of !LeftAndMain->CMSVersion() - not failing on empty $URL$ placeholder with subversion path to determine version numbers
 * ![66269] Merged from trunk; fix !DataObject::hasDatabaseFields()
 * ![66266] Fix test/cookie conflict in !ErrorPage rendering
 * ![66252] Immediately apply behaviours that are added after the Behaviour.apply() call, in Behaviour.register() calls as well as Class.applyTo() calls
 * ![66251] Removed unnecessary and bug-causing Behaviour.apply() call.
 * ![66250] Made Behaviour.apply calls more specific
 * ![66229] Added flash button to tinymce_ssbuttons
 * ![66196] #2714 - Cookie::set doesn't operate correctly with expiryDays 0 (wakeless)
 * ![66195] #2694 - Mathspam question clear
 * ![66194] Fixed draggable bug in !AssetTableField - thanks for ajshort for the patch - ticket #3051
 * ![66162] #118 - Fixed count of marked pages (hamish)
 * ![66137] Fixed editable formfields not showing up in translation mode (#3083). Updated Translatable->updateCMSFields() by partially merging wakeless' patch from (r64523)

 * ![66135] Fixed field labels for original readonly fields in translation mode
 * ![66107] Fixed PHP variable initialization in !SiteTree->getClassDropdown() which broke class dropdown in behaviour tab (regression from r66092)
 * ![66091] $cache flag wasn't passend through from !ViewableData_Customised->XML_val() to !ViewableData->XML_val()
 * ![66079] #3051 ajshort: Improved layout of assettablefield drag icon
 * ![66070] Fixed HTTP->findByTagAndAttribute missing variable error causing !HtmlEditorField to break since it used HTTP::getLinksIn()
 * ![66067] #3065: Fixed restore page
 * ![66066] #3012 jam13: Fixed tabstrip default tab selection when working with querystrings
 * ![66065] Fixed security tabs for JSoD code
 * ![66062] #3063: Allow old-school method of adding menu items to !LeftAndMiain:
 * ![66052] #3087 simon_w: Added !ResfulService::connect() back, for backward compatability
 * ![66049] Fixed unescaped html display in !DevelopmentAdmin (#3080)
 * ![66044] Fixed <% require %> call in !ModelAdmin_left.ss
 * ![66043] Fix PHP notice where variable with array didn't exist in HTTP->findByTagAndAttribute()
 * ![66029] use a undefined variable $member.
 * ![66027] Fixed incorrect call to Permission::checkMember() - missing second argument, first argument should've been a Member object or Member ID
 * ![66026] Fixed PHP notice level error in some circumstances in !DataObject->buildDataObjectSet()
 * ![65944] #3073: Fixed !LeftAndMain::deleteitems()
 * ![65923] #3066: Fix ?isDev=1 option
 * ![65900] #2868: Fix after-popup-close behaviour on security member table
 * ![65899] #2820: Fixed use of buggy reflection in Object::uninherited()
 * ![65896] #2706: Fixed JS error in multi-nested pages deletion
 * ![65895] #2232: Prevent requirements from breaking !ErrorPage publication
 * ![65894] #1721: Fixed del/ins styling in page comparison
 * ![65881] Don't let permission errors on assets/ folder completely prevent javascript from loading
 * ![65865] Fixed tabstrip JS error in !ReportAdmin
 * ![65863] Ensure that menu items of the same priority show the first added item closes to the left
 * ![65860] Fixed JS error in !ReportAdmin
 * ![65851] #3062: Fixed ondemand support for jQuery responses as well as prototype
 * ![65850] Alow decoration of Member with has_many relationships
 * ![65843] #3062: Fixed ondemand support for jQuery responses as well as prototype
 * ![65842] #3061: Text.!FirstSentence returns '.' instead of empty string on an empty field
 * ![65827] Fixed flash uploader not searching for the correct files, due to changes in r65820
 * ![65825] Tidied up messages in flash uploader right hand panel in CMS
 * ![65769] Fixed deletion of !RedirectorPage

 * ![65761] Missing variable in some circumstances caused Requirements::include_in_response() to break
 * ![65711] Added support for CSS media types to CSS on demand
 * ![65680] there is no horizontal scroll bar for Model Admin right panel if the results table is long.
 * ![65671] temp fix for flash inserter.
 * ![65616] Fixed searching on sapphire/trunk due to Form changes - !FormAction was useless on !SearchForm anyway
 * ![65612] Removed offending $this->canEdit() which returned a boolean, not appropriate to be passed into Member::mapInCMSGroups()
 * ![65583] Adjusted Translatable to api changes from r65581
 * ![65554] a lot of methods in this class now passed $params as HTTPRequest object, rather than as a array if the function is called from Ajax or top-level of front-end, some method is called in both manner, ie. called from Ajax and called internally as well, so we need to check $params type and do further process. This is a partial fix of open source ticket #3035
 * ![65539] Setting correct user locale in !ImageField and !FileIframeField - the controller is separate from the CMS context, so wasn't initialized with i18n (see #1727)
 * ![65538] Using '!SiteTree' classname instead of 'Page' in !UpgradeSiteTreePermissionSchemaTask to avoid clashes in schema when Page.php has its own tables
 * ![65536] Making Metadata fields writeable in translation mode (see #2993)
 * ![65518] Removed project-specific hack in !DataObject->getManyManyComponentsQuery() as it was breaking Translatable saving
 * ![65517] Fixed breadcrumb exploding in !DebugView when base-URL is "/" - was confusing the str_replace() logic
 * ![65515] Fixed Translatable::default_lang() call in CMSMain
 * ![65512] Fixed !SiteTreeMaintenanceTask from extending unkown class Task to extending Controller
 * ![65510] #3015: Fixed close buttons on tinymce side panels

 * ![65469] Better initial-site-setup boundary condition checking needed after the manifest builder update
 * ![65462] Setting Director::set_site_mode('site') in !RootURLController in newly added init() method, which fixes Translatable::choose_site_lang(). The original bug was a wrong selected language in the <meta> tags through !SiteTree->!MetaTags()
 * ![65456] Using uncached !DataObject::get_one() calls in !ModelAsController to avoid stale data with subsequent Director::test() calls which alter the page relations inbetween
 * ![65424] #2987 - IE8 support via IE7 compatability mode
 * ![65394] Fixed broken dev/build compilation of manifest
 * ![65361] Added SSViwer support for i18n namespaces in templates with <% _t('!MyNamespace.!MyEntity', ... %>, to work around magically added namespaces from the parsed template file. Those auto-namespaces were logically not working in includes, as the parsing context is always the including template. Legacy support for auto-namespaces is still present due to its high usage.
 * ![65336] Making !ModelAdmin labels in left panel translatable again (regression from moving them into one common panel)
 * ![65335] Respecting $dontEscape in !FormAction
 * ![65293] Using empty title in !TreeDropdownField->Field() if the related !DataObject cannot be found
 * ![65291] Reverted text replacement performance improvement in SQLQuery - it was replacing more ocurrences via str_replace() than the previous implementation based on arrays, which broke queries augmented by Translatable (originally committed in r60468 and r54044)
 * ![65282] Fixed page comment javascript to suit new Form name
 * ![65275] #2243: Fixed !ViewableData::Odd
 * ![65271] #2630 - Removed notice-level error
 * ![65269] #2954 - Fixed support for negative numbers in decimal fields
 * ![65250] #2992: Fixed T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM error in !RequestHandler

 * ![65232] #2056: Removed all references to deprecated Member::isAdmin()
 * ![65229] Allow DBField::__construct() without a name
 * ![65214] Remove !LeftAndMain entry from CMSMenu (#3014). Thanks to hamish for the patch!
 * ![65213] Only enforcing record-level permissions in !LeftAndMain if passed ID is numeric to avoid breaking !AssetAdmin with string-based IDs (regression from r65152). See #3017
 * ![65212] Calling parent constructor in !ComplexTableField_!ItemRequest, was confusing !RequestHandler
 * ![65180] Add magic methods on !ModelAdmin to $allowed_actions (regression from r64988)
 * ![65174] MemberTableField use of sourceFilter should be treated as a string, not an array as per the API of !TableListField
 * ![65152] Enforce permission checks in !LeftAndMain and CMSMain through !SiteTree->canView()/canEdit()/canAddChildren()/canPublish()/canDelete() (see #2701)
 * ![65151] Fixed !SiteTreeAccess.js DOM IDs to field changes made in r65150
 * ![65150] Disallow !SiteTree->canEdit() if !SiteTree->canView() is not granted
 * ![65148] Fixed js error in !LeftAndMain_right.js when displaying readonly pages
 * ![65141] TableField delete row inconsistency with !TableListField which caused table fields to not fade the row out
 * ![65135] Fixed call to Member function that didn't exist
 * ![65127] Fix potential PHP notice opening a !ComplexTableField popup
 * ![65123] Fixed bug with ID-less generation of !YamlFixture entries that trigger $this->write() in setters
 * ![65106] Setting menu titles for CMSMenu items in !LeftAndMain::init() to get translated values for the current user locale (see #2873)
 * ![65104] Fixed menu titles entity references in CMSMain and !AssetAdmin
 * ![65094] Fixed !SearchContextTest to comply to new scaffolded searchfield in Text DBFIeld
 * ![65071] Reverted auto-detection of i18n statics like $db in !DataObject through provideI18nEntities() - was getting too complicated with decorated properties. Overload !DataObject->fieldLabels() or !DataObjectDecorator->updateFieldLabels() instead
 * ![65063] Checking for array existence before iterating through !DataObjectDecorator->provideI18nEntities()
 * ![65062] Dont instanciate abstract classes in i18nTextCollector
 * ![65061] Using !SiteTree::get_by_url() (see r65060)
 * ![65057] Collecting i18n entities for decorators separately from the decorated classes, as decorated properties like $db have to be stored in the module of the decorated, not in the module of the decorated class.
 * ![65030] Different class_implements() usage without instanciating the class in i18nTextCollector - not all classes are instanciatable without arguments. This raises the minimum requirement for text collection to PHP 5.1+
 * ![65028] Fixed !SecurityAdminTest to work with i18n enabled
 * ![65026] Fixed !CsvBulkLoaderTest to comply to hasHeaderRow API change (r64806)
 * ![65024] Fixed CMSMainTest to check for translated entities to avoid failing tests with i18n enabled
 * ![65023] Changed i18nTextCollectorTest to only trigger _t() calls in instance methods (they don't fully work in __construct()). Manually adding !ClassInfo state for the fakewebroot needed to test textcollection - !ManifestBuilder/!ClassInfo currently don't support setting of other webroots, or flexible inclusion/exclusion of certain subfolders which would be necessary to do this without hacks.
 * ![64981] Don't allow calling of magically added methods via URL unless explicitly listed in allowed_actions

 * ![64736] Fixed non-object or not null error in !TreeSelectorField
 * ![64732] New folders weren't getting their name set correctly, instead they would just be called "!NewFolder". This occurred in the Site Content section of the CMS, creating a folder using the right hand panel in that section.
 * ![64604] Fixed incorrectly reverted methods related to sizing of the popup.
 * ![64601] Fixed extra class addition on various !FormField->Field() methods
 * ![64562] Using include_once() instead of include() for _ss_environment.php in install.php and Core.php to avoid PHP notice errors about double constant defines (see r64561)
 * ![64506] Renamed "Save & Publish" to "Save and Publish" since this value is used in the value attribute of input elements, properly parsed, this would produce &amp; instead of &
 * ![64494] Fixed distribution of textcollector files to modules (was collecting all entities into all modules before) - added unit tests
 * ![64491] Fixed wrongly formatted _t() call in Security class
 * ![64490] Fixed $module parameter for i18nTextCollectorTask
 * ![64471] Fix issue with language files not being included

 * ![64466] posix_isatty sometimes returns a benign error
 * ![64462] Don't run migration code for permissions if the old field doesn't exist.
 * ![64443] Fixed !RestfulServerTest fixture path
 * ![64440] Unit tests for !RestfulServer (see r64439)

 * ![64438] Removed $headingLevel reference from !LabelField (was supposed to go into !HeaderField)
 * ![64437] Second constructor argument $title for !HeaderField should be optional for legacy reasons
 * ![64427] Using !PasswordField instead of deprecated !EncryptField
 * ![64423] Adjusted !HeaderField and !LabelField implementation to new constructor arguments (see r64421)
 * ![64422] Adjusted !HeaderField and !LabelField implementation to new constructor arguments (see r64421)
 * ![64361] #2963 - Fix RSSFeed to work with new add_cache_headers
 * ![64334] Reverted Member->isAdmin() removal since it's being used in a lot of places, we shouldn't deprecated it... yet.
 * ![64329] correct wrong syntax of !TableField class in its frontend javascript
 * ![64328] avoid a CSSClass is added to a veiwable data twice.
 * ![64325] $this->extraData is not alway set for an !TableField_Item
 * ![64320] If !DropdownField->Field() lack of source checking before looping through it
 * ![64318] Fixed !DropdownField handling of Iterator objects rather than arrays in the newly created getSource()
 * ![64314] If ajaxActionsOnTop is called twice, the actions are removed.
 * ![64313] Don't use singleton() to create !DataFormatter instances, as it will cause weird side-effects with multiple formatter instances with different parameters (broke subsequent test runs of !RestfulServerTest and !SoapModelAccessTest) - all aboard the failboat!
 * ![64310] Unsetting $_SERVER globals in !RestfulServerTest to avoid side-effects across unit tests
 * ![64309] Added !RestfulServerTest->testApiAccessBoolean()
 * ![64307] Fixed !RestfulServerTest->testAuthenticatedGET()
 * ![64275] fixed default_country_value so that it will actually call the default country if IP lookup doesnt work
 * ![64263] Fix disappearing fields when a field without a name was being pushed onto a !FieldSet (eg a !CompositeField)
 * ![64251] Fixed !ComplexTableField->saveComplexTableField() success message object link - was assuming same context as !ComplexTableField_!ItemRequest
 * ![64239] Adjusted !ForeignKey->scaffoldFormField() to new scaffolding notation ("ajaxSafe" instead of "ajax")
 * ![64237] Fixed !FormScaffolder string literal parsing FALE in getFieldSet()
 * ![64229] Storing HTTP "Referer" header from $_SERVER in Director::direct() and passing it along in Director::test()
 * ![64228] Checking for an empty array for $postVars in Director::test() to determine HTTP method - an existing array should cause POST rather than GET, even if its empty
 * ![64227] Fixed stupid ommission from r64223 which caused HTTPRequest to construct without a proper URL
 * ![64224] Using fieldLabel() for $has_one relationships in !FormScaffolder
 * ![64173] Fixed wrong call to scaffoldCMSFields() in Member->getCMSFields(), removed addScaffoldRelationFields() call as this is done by the newly called parent::getCMSFields() already

 * ![64142] fixed ss.i18n.sprintf() call in Validator.js
 * ![64124] #2936: Define STDOUT if it's not already defined...
 * ![64109] Fixed order of arguments.
 * ![64099] Bad XHTML in en_US language file (#2624) - thanks tiwoc!
 * ![64098] Director::fileExists() fails on windows with absolute paths (#2935) - thanks to ajshort!
 * ![64097] Fixed CSSContentParser to only use tidy on CLI mode if its available, and first check for existence of PHP tidy extension. Fixes failing unit tests on standard WAMP windows installations.
 * ![64096] Fixed CSVParser assumptions about absolute unix-style filepaths - using Director::absFile() instead now
 * ![64081] Consistent usage of ss.i18n.sprintf() instead of ss.i18n.printf() - the method is returning a string rather than outputting directly, so should be sprintf()
 * ![64077] Fixing !AssetAdmin translations which were previously moved to Folder.php - i18n::include_by_class() doesn't like filenames/namespaces which are in a different folder than the language file they're referenced in (see #2359) - started in r64076
 * ![64076] Fixing !AssetAdmin translations which were previously moved to Folder.php - i18n::include_by_class() doesn't like filenames/namespaces which are in a different folder than the language file they're referenced in (see #2359)

 * ![64042] Using _t() to check content strings in unit tests and avoid tests failing when i18n is enabled

 * ![64013] Limited error message scope on invalid classname for !TestRunner
 * ![64011] Ignore !TestOnly classes when collecting permissions
 * ![64010] Removed dependency of ss.i18n.js on other libraries by replacing $$ with document.getElementsByTagName() and implementing a custom event attacher - see #2927
 * ![64007] Making less assumptions about object structure in !FieldSet->addFieldToTab() error messages
 * ![64005] YamlFixture->saveIntoDatabase(): In order to support reflexive relations which need a valid object ID, the record is written twice: first after populating all non-relational fields, then again after populating all relations (has_one, has_many, many_many). Fixes a bug where !FileTest was testing onBeforeWrite() behaviour
 * ![64004] Writing record from yml before parsing relations in !YamlFixture->saveIntoDatabase() to avoid missing lookups for reflexive relations on the same object
 * ![64002] Moved !RecordController and !CollectionController to external module (see r63905)
 * ![64001] Adjusted !FormTest->testLoadDataFromObject() to new assumptions about changed behaviour on loadDataFrom() from $loadBlanks to $clearMissingFields - which means that form fields are cleared regardless if they have blank values in the passed object or not
 * ![64000] Making sure that !DataObject->has*Field() methods always return an array, in order not to fail any array_key_exists() checks
 * ![63999] Fixing !DataObject->hasField() to detect dynamic getters by using hasMethod("get$fieldName")
 * ![63998] Fixed Form->loadDataFrom() to properly populate !FormField->setValue() when an object is passed as the first parameter (needed e.g. for !CheckboxSetField->setValue()) - see mailinglist discussion at http://groups.google.com/group/silverstripe-dev/browse_thread/thread/717bada8ccafdd70

 * ![63839] Added missing default english text to i18n call in !TableField and !TableListField javascript
 * ![63828] MemberTableField_Popup had an odd way of overloading saveComplexTableField() - this should be on !MemberTableField instead, since that's the direct subclass of !ComplexTableField for where saveComplexTableField() is defined. This broke the "Add Member" button in CMS Security, probably due to the way the form URLs have been changed. See ticket #2907 for the reported problem.
 * ![63825] Don't let Director::test() clobber current stage
 * ![63824] Fix !FieldSet::replaceField() so that it doesn't clobber tabs

 * ![63804] Side reports weren't working on initial opening of the side tab
 * ![63799] Fixed blatant error where $SNG_member wasn't defined
 * ![63797] Member->getCMSFields() should use scaffoldCMSFields() instead of scaffoldFormFields() - currently it is operating in the wrong context.
 * ![63793] MemberTableField->!AddLink() was calling &methodName=add - this should be just "add", as per changes to the forum URLs in sapphire
 * ![63786] Removed query that was causing issues displaying members in the security groups. Open ticket #2591
 * ![63785] URLs to security groups in CMS were not linked correctly. Removed Director::link() references and replaced with strings. Director::link() is deprecated and shouldn't be used.
 * ![63769] Fixed paths to CSV fixtures for case-sensitive file systems.
 * ![63768] Fixed $fixture_file for Ext2fs and other case-sensitive file systems.
 * ![63748] Use of getOwnerID() in !ReportAdmin which doesn't make sense, since ID() is sufficient.
 * ![63739] Fixed bug in getCMSFields scaffolding of relations
 * ![63716] Fixed createTag for proper generation of !DropdownField blank items
 * ![63698] Only include i18n.js if javascript files are included - and to be safe, include the required prototype.js along with the library
 * ![63691] Removed old reference to ?executeForm=!EditForm
 * ![63681] Requiring a parentController for !RecordController
 * ![63649] Fixed unclear SQL escaping responsibilities in !SearchFilter subclasses - it now expects unescaped data, and escapes automatically when adding to the query)
 * ![63647] Making "add %s" translatable for !ComplexTableField
 * ![63640] Automatically including sapphire/javascript/i18n.js in Requirements::process_i18n_javascript() to avoid errors when Requirements are manually overwritten

 * ![63634] Reverted earlier change to !ModelAdmin.js statusMessage() display
 * ![63629] Translated Member formfields through fieldLabels()
 * ![63627] php notice in !CountryDropdownField
 * ![63622] Disabled user_error in !ComplexTableField->sourceID() when no formfield 'ID' is found in !ComplexTableField->$detailFormFields - not strictly required as we can deduce it from the URL. It was causing conflicts with !DataObject->scaffoldFormFields() not returning an 'ID' field
 * ![63621] Making sure that Dataobject->getManyManyJoin() inserts a valid database table for the relation - not all component classes returned by !ComponentSet->ownerClass are valid tables (see r54797 and r60909 for previous commits on this issue)
 * ![63618] Escaping added database columns in queries for !TableListField
 * ![63611] typo mentioned in #2775

 * ![63464] Fixed hardcoded HTTP protocol information in !BasicAuth
 * ![63457] AssetAdmin->Link() returned a trailing slash that was not necessary. See ticket #2884
 * ![63452] Fixed !ReportAdmin breakages - changes to HTTPRequest required that show($params) be changes to show($request) and then check $request->allParams() for the URL parameters - this caused major breakages as this code was not updated to reflect the new URL handling changes.
 * ![63432] #2753: Couldn't have fields named the same as methods
 * ![63304] #2529: Fixed HTTP/1.0 support
 * ![63297] Fixed loading indicator in for add form in !ModelAdmin.js
 * ![63296] wrong jsparty PATH references
 * ![63295] wrong jsparty PATH references
 * ![63294] Fixed !ModelAdmin Requirements path references
 * ![63291] Don't try to use HTTP_HOST environment variable if its not set in Director::protocolAndHost(). Throw a warning, then return false - before if script execution was not set to stop on WARNING, you'll get a NOTICE as well.
 * ![63290] Moved *_PATH and PR_*constants from main.php/cli-script.php back to Core.php - was causing problems with installer (directly includes Core.php, but doesn't run through main.php) - see ticket #2867 for improvement suggestions in bootstrapping code to avoid these bugs
 * ![63204] Moved TEMP_FOLDER define back from main.php/cli-script.php to Core.php, as it was causing problems with the installer

 * ![62909] Fixed bug introduced into !AssetTableField by previous CTF change
 * ![62892] #2721 - Show decent preview on !FileIFrameField

 * ![62875] More robust setting of defaults; necessary due to altered !ViewableData::__isset()
 * ![62868] #2697 - Removed junk slash from login message
 * ![62701] Changed URL format for password sent confirmation display, to avoid issues with new request handling trying to detect the email-TLD as a pseudo-file-extension (which resulted in truncated email-addresses in display). Old: /Security/passwordsent/myemailaddress. New: Security/passwordsent/?email=myemailaddress
 * ![62490] createTag() on !FormField subclasses should use getTabIndex() instead of getTabIndexHTML() as createTag() is responsible for generating the HTML, and all we need is the tabindex value
 * ![62471] Allowing HTTPRequest::match() to match rules with extensions (e.g. /sitemap.xml used for !GoogleSitemap)
 * ![62463] Pushing current controller into stack in !RootURLController->handleRequest to Session-usage in Translatable if enabled. Session::get() is dependent on controllers, and is needed to determine the current language for any Translatable queries (like !RootURLController::get_homepage_urlsegment())
 * ![62381] Type checking problem in !LookupField->Field(), merged in from r62387
 * ![62325] Removed !DataReport.js calls in !LeftAndMain until we figure out a better way of doing
 * ![62324] Removed !DataReport.js calls in !LeftAndMain until we figure out a better way of doing

 * ![61151] ComplexTableField_popup.css "overflow: auto" should only be applied to the container HTML element instead of HTML and BODY which can

 * ![60710] Fixed $this reference in static Member call
 * ![60643] Reinstated error_handling(E_ALL) for dev environments in main.php after clarifying with sam - we want to force developers to recard notice-level errors unless they expicitly opt-out in their _config.php
 * ![60636] Disabled mandatory override of default PHP error handler to E_ALL when in dev mode (which means you have no way of overriding error_reporting() in your _config.php, and by that no way of disabling e.g. E_NOTICE level errors)
 * ![60635] Fixed CMSMainTest to use /admin/crm as a standard URL rather than /admin (which could be overloaded by other admins for application-like interfaces without CMS components)
 * ![60573] Fixed bug with unpaginated !TableListFields.  Added tests for !TableListField pagination
 * ![60415] Added Requirements::path_for_file() to support external URLs in required paths (incl. unit test)
 * ![60413] Fixed !RequirementsTest combine_files() testing to accept new javascript inclusion format with added modified flags

 * ![59281] Fixed colspan on <td class="actions"> in !MemberTableField.ss


=== Enhancement ===
 * ![71650] Applying the asynch request patch to our tag field. We use a simple queue management idea to keep only the latest ajax request is valid, ie, we abort all requests before the current request is submitted, so that there is only at most one request spanning in the client side, so no early request's response cover late request's response, also greatly enhance the performance of both sides, especially in case of complicated operations in server side and complicated post-events in client side.
 * ![71597] delete button keep spinning when cancel a deletion operation from the confirm window.
 * ![70956] Ticket 2756: Newsletter performance problem, run out of memory.
 * ![70861] Allow selection of the unique identifier field on Member by setting Member::set_unique_identifier_field(!AnotherField). Default is "Email".
 * ![70846] When !MemberLoginForm controller page has loaded, focus on the Email input field so the user doesn't have to focus the field themselves. Ticket #3418
 * ![70809] Removed blacklist newsletter specific code out of core and into newsletter module
 * ![70783] Export to CSV data of !MemberTableField gets all fields on the member from the db array, instead of just !FirstName, Surname and Email

 * ![70190] Added nicer (and more useful) error message if !ErrorPage cannot open the error HTML file for writing
 * ![70131] Creation of a new page type now uses a consistent source of classes that respect $hide_ancestor on !SiteTree.
 * ![70064] Default to "Page" for new page type dropdown
 * ![70060] Added a table for showing linked pages in the Report -> !BackLinks tab
 * ![69954] Calling augmentSQL() on decorators in !DataObject::get(), which is necessary (among others) to limit !ContentController->getMenu() with Translatable enabled to the currently active language. Was previously just implemented in !DataObject::get_one()
 * ![69953] Passing through same arguments in !SiteTree::get_by_url() than in the wrapped !DataObject::get_one()
 * ![69952] Removing specialized routing for Translatable from Director->currentPage() and !ModelAsController->getNestedController. Calls !SiteTree::get_by_url() now, which abstracts out the Translatable handling.
 * ![69924] #3313 gigtech: Added !ComplexTableField::setAddTitle()
 * ![69909] Allowing for passing of $context in Hierarchy->markChildren()
 * ![69896] Allowing more arguments in Object->extend() (merged from branches/translatable in r64523, thanks wakeless!)

 * ![69891] Moved i18n::get_existing_content_languages() to correct namespace in Translatable::get_existing_content_languages().
 * ![69888] Added !DataObjectSet->replace()

 * ![69833] Separated the class name for captioned images to normal images, so styling can be separately applied
 * ![69824] Caption support for the !HtmlEditorField in the SS CMS. Ticket #2937
 * ![69823] Caption support for the TinyMCE editor in the SS CMS. Ticket #2937
 * ![69821] #3180: Added !RsyncMultiHostPubilsher to 2.3 from trunk
 * ![69734] Allow specifying application URL for the top right logo instead of hardcoded silverstripe.com. Thanks hamish!

 * ![69323] Added styling for "form .message.notice" in sapphire/css/Form.css
 * ![69322] More readable (and linked) output of "you are comparing..." message when viewing version of a page
 * ![69244] Added renameField() to !FieldSet
 * ![69224] Allow choosing ellipsis for truncated text on Text->!LimitWordCountXML()
 * ![69218] Added ability to define the ellipsis for !LimitWordCount() setting "..." as the default
 * ![69207] Changed order of array merging in !DataObject->db() - contains fields from subclasses at end of the array instead of the beginning. Important because db() is used by !FormScaffolder, which shoved custom fields on the front of auto-generated forms. Shouldn't have any effect on the actual content of returned array
 * ![69204] Hiding Member->!BlacklistedEmail field in getCMSFields() by default - only relevant in newsletter/bounce context at the moment
 * ![68860] Added !RestfulServerTest->testGETRelationshipsXML()
 * ![68818] Appending classnames to translated pagetype titles in CMSMain->getPageTypes() when the cms is loaded in a non-english version - see inline comment
 * ![68817] Appending classnames to translated pagetype titles in !SiteTree->getClassDropdown() when the cms is loaded in a non-english version - see inline comment
 * ![68771] Improved display of class permissions in /admin/security by using the menu title in addition to the classname (users won't necessarily know which classname an admin area corresponds to). Also using "Access to all CMS interfaces" as a permission description for CMS_ACCESS_!LeftAndMain
 * ![68761] Making Date->Ago() translatable
 * ![68747] Using i18nEntityProvider on !SiteTree to ensure entities in "Page" namespace get stored on sapphire instead of the "module folder" for Page.php - we can't make those properties translatable within core if they are in a custom folder
 * ![68745] Allowing textcollection of multiple modules selectively
 * ![68701] Allow !HtmlEditorField on front-end forms
 * ![68508] Checking for $_FILE_TO_URL_MAPPING in !DevelopmentAdmin if called in CLI mode to avoid nasty bugs e.g. during !FunctionalTest sessions (Example: Controller stack was failing for some weird reason in !LeftAndMainTest)
 * ![68460] Added CMSMenu::get_viewable_menu_items() and using it in !LeftAndMain->!MainMenu()
 * ![68193] Added Email->setTemplate() and Email->getTemplate() (as the Email_Template class is deprecated)
 * ![68160] Added support for specifying target module in i18nEntitityProvider->provideEntities()
 * ![68156] Added support for specifying target module in i18nEntitityProvider->provideEntities()
 * ![67984] Documented and improved !DataObjectSet->!PaginationSummary(). Removed !DataObjectSet->paginationSummaryDots
 * ![67675] Fixed Email::obfuscate() to include custom CSS for reversing the email address using the "direction" method
 * ![67638] Added "reverse" method to Email::obfuscate() to reverse the email address in PHP, then CSS can be used to reverse it back to normal to avoid email harvesting
 * ![67502] Added SSViewer::get_source_file_comments()
 * ![67422] Allow setting of the legend value in the Form template by use of Form->setLegend('my legend')

 * ![67292] Supporting object parameter in !FieldSet->makeFieldReadonly()
 * ![67291] Added mock controller instances to each !FunctionalTest, which passes the existing mock session object into the controller stack. This means Sesssion::get()/set() in application code will use the test session. Helpful mainly for overriding login information used by Member::currentUser().
 * ![67242] Make it easier to create pageless subclasses of Page_Controller
 * ![67224] Adding "close popup" link after saving /admin/myprofile (see #3195)
 * ![67139] Added !TreeDropdownField->refresh() js method
 * ![67138] Allowing usage of extraClass() in !TreeDropdownField
 * ![67083] Using TEMP_FOLDER for !StaticExporter
 * ![67072] Disallowing CMSMain->revert() if !SiteTree->canPublish() is not granted (used to be !SiteTree->canEdit()). If a user isn't allowed to publish, he shouldn't be allowed to revert the live state of a page either.
 * ![67061] Moving "save" and "delete" cms actions from CMSMain->!EditForm() into !SiteTree->getCMSActions() to make them decoratable (e.g. disallow delete action) and easier to cover with unit tests. Leaving fallback "save" and "delete" actions in CMSMain in case no actions are defined (necessary e.g. for Group class in !SecurityAdmin)
 * ![66958] Added !SearchForm->setPageLength() and !SearchForm->getPageLength()
 * ![66946] Add <%-- --%> comments
 * ![66830] Disabled sending of warnings through Debug::send_errors_to() by default. If you need extended error reporting including warnings (e.g. for a site which is still in active development), use Debug::send_errors_to('example@example.com', true) or Debug::send_warnings_to('example@example.com')
 * ![66803] Just redirect back after "import" action called, and set the session message on the Form object instead of hardcoded ID
 * ![66654] Renamed tab "Meta-data" to "Metadata" for better readability (see #3142)
 * ![66646] Fixed default level in !HeaderField - was duplicating defaults already present in two other places (see r66639)
 * ![66625] Allow !CheckboxSetField to use extra classes as other !FormField classes do. Also dded test for this behaviour in !CheckboxSetFieldTest.
 * ![66622] Sort test class list by alphabetical order so it's easier to read
 * ![66596] Defaulting to show all columns in !ModelAdmin CSV export, ignoring user selection of result table columns (users can always limit CSV columns by manually deleting them e.g. in Excel)
 * ![66583] Added experimental support using (relname)Query methods to pass complex relations (those defined by methods) into searchfilter
 * ![66343] Added comments in rendered templates to indicate the source .ss files, on dev sites only:
 * ![66333] Added !ConfirmedPasswordField->setShowOnClickTitle()
 * ![66323] If there are no files in a folder in !AssetAdmin, show a message
 * ![66322] Added !SearchFormTest
 * ![66320] Added more known file extensions (tiff, js, html, css, ico) to File->getFileType()
 * ![66312] Added support for $relationCallbacks on the importer class (in addition to methods on the model class)
 * ![66173] Moving !GoogleSitemap functionality (priority dropdown and database fields) from !SiteTree to !GoogleSitemapDecorator
 * ![66168] Removed !GoogleSitemap references in !SiteTree (moving to decorator implementation)
 * ![66137] Added !TranslatableTest with minimal assertions about existing form fields in translation mode
 * ![66045] Added support for custom importer methods in !CsvBulkLoader
 * ![65827] Added error messages to flash uploader panel, to be consistent with the image uploader one
 * ![65582] Using actual classname in !DataObjectSet->debug()
 * ![65581] Added unit tests for !FieldSet->insertBefore()/insertAfter()
 * ![65513] Using currently used content languages for options in the TinyMCE spellchecker (see http://open.silverstripe.com/ticket/2498#comment:2)
 * ![65508] Added language tables for tinymce_ssbuttons Plugin, incl. German translation
 * ![65495] Calling !UpgradeSiteTreePermissionSchemaTask from !SiteTree->requireDefaultRecords as a temporary workaround for missing migration infrastructure. This means that upgrading the schema for 2.3 can be done without manual task triggers, just the usual dev/build (see http://open.silverstripe.com/ticket/2847#comment:4)
 * ![65494] Added !DatabaseTest
 * ![65464] Better CLI output for browsing dev/tests
 * ![65463] Allowing strings instead of arrays in !ModelAdmin::$managed_models to make it less error-prone for beginners
 * ![65457] Allowing to pass strings instead of arrays into !FunctionalTest->assert*() methods, and convert them internally to arrays
 * ![65455] Adjusted !AssetAdmin to Folder->can*() changes
 * ![65454] Added !LeftAndMainDecorator
 * ![65453] Added stub methods to !DataObjectDecorator for documentation purposes
 * ![65452] Allowing decoration of can*() methods in File and Folder
 * ![65361] Added unit tests for i18n template parsing
 * ![65266] Folder name can now be used for uploading files. Ticket #3026 - Thanks simon_w!
 * ![65181] Updated !LeftAndMain->getMenuTitle() to use classname as fallback if $menu_title is not defined - one less thing to specify in a minimalist !ModelAdmin subclass
 * ![65173] Refactored CSS applied to filter boxes by using common selector
 * ![65153] Added !UpgradeSiteTreePermissionSchemaTask as a manual migration of !SiteTree schema upgrades in 2.3 (see #2847)
 * ![65150] Added unit tests for !SiteTree permissions
 * ![65147] Only logging out users on Security::permissionFailure() is called in non-ajax context. For ajax requests, we now return a 403 HTTP Status in a HTTPResponse Object, with a ":NOTLOGGEDIN" body for backwards compatibility. If a logout+redirection is required after an ajax-request, this should be handled by the clientside.
 * ![65125] Added a "strict-mode" for Member->inGroup() and Member->inGroups() to determine true membership to a group (without inheritance)
 * ![65092] Scaffolding !TextField instead of !TextareaField in Text DBField due to size
 * ![65073] Added fieldLabels() overloading to various !DataObject subclasses. Use this method instead of directly calling _t() in getCMSFields(), and use fieldLabel('!MyField') to get the label for a specific !FormField. This way, we can transparently support formfield scaffolding and re-use the labels for search fields automatically.
 * ![65072] Added fieldLabels() overloading to various !DataObject subclasses. Use this method instead of directly calling _t() in getCMSFields(), and use fieldLabel('!MyField') to get the label for a specific !FormField. This way, we can transparently support formfield scaffolding and re-use the labels for search fields automatically.
 * ![65056] Removed !DataObjectDecorator->updateSummaryFieldsExcludeExtra() - was a straight copy of updateSummaryFields()...
 * ![65055] More solid fulltext checks against master language tables in i18nTextCollectorTest
 * ![65054] Using eval() in textcollector to test for valid PHP syntax
 * ![65051] Added unit tests for i18nTextCollector handling of newlines in entity values
 * ![65029] Using namespaces for filenames in !RequirementsTest
 * ![65027] Using safer get_by_id() call in !SecurityAdmin->getMemberForm()
 * ![65022] Added i18nEntityProvider interface (see comments in #1625) incl. unit tests
 * ![65020] Allowing translation of some static properties on !DataObject and subclasses through !DataObject->fieldLabels(). Part of the provideI18nEntities() work which was started in r64881 (see #1625)
 * ![64881] Ignoring entity-names with $ signs (most likely dynamic properties) in i18nTextCollector->collectFromCode()
 * ![64878] Added unit tests for i18n.js
 * ![64682] Changed !FormField->Field() to make use of !FormField->createTag() over complicated dynamic string building
 * ![64596] Allow use of !RestfulService->setQueryString() and test to support it. Patch from ticket #2973. Thanks to simon_w!
 * ![64558] Used _t() entity instead of hardcoded "not set" string in !TextareaField->Field()

 * ![64552] If !TextField->disabled has been set to true, then add the "disabled" attribute to the input type text attribute list
 * ![64551] Made use of !FormField->createTag() functionality for creating a textarea field in !TextareaField->Field()
 * ![64494] Using ksort() in textcollector to get alphabetized language master files (=easier to compare and debug)
 * ![64493] Made _t() global function in Core.php an alias for the new i18n::_t() method
 * ![64492] Refactored i18nTextCollector and added unit tests

 * ![64446] Improved !TaskRunner and !BuildTask metadata and styling
 * ![64421] Using createTag() to create !HeaderField and !LabelField, which adds support for HTML id attributes and extra css classes through addExtraClass()
 * ![64410] Made use of createTag() on !FormAction->Field()
 * ![64408] Added ID to allow CSS styling of forgot password link on !MemberLoginForm
 * ![64406] Added a message if no email address was specified, for user feedback purposes on !MemberLoginForm->forgotPassword()
 * ![64405] Changed the "I've lost my password" action to a link instead, since the button is too prominent, and usability is poor  having this as a form submit button.
 * ![64397] Versioned::get_one_by_stage() and Versioned::get_by_stage() were missing parameters from their get_one() and get() counterparts in !DataObject. Those parameters have been added. See ticket #2965 for the origin of this patch.

 * ![63762] Added unit tests for "_unchanged" handling in Form->loadDataFrom()
 * ![63761] Added unit tests for Form->loadDataFrom()
 * ![63748] Added missing "abstract" Report class to compliment !ReportAdmin. Currently it is unclear what abstract base class you're supposed to implement from.

 * ![63653] Added Controller->getRequest()
 * ![63652] Added Controller->render($params) as a shortcut for Controller->customise($params)->renderWith(array('!MyTemplate','!MySubTemplate')) - templates are auto-detected by Controller->getViewer() and Controller->getAction()

 * ![63628] Added !FieldSet->hasTabSet() incl. unit test
 * ![63626] Removed overloaded !MemberTableField->!DetailForm() and reduced overloaded constructor logic - same behaviour found in parent classes
 * ![63624] Scaffolding Member->getCMSFields() to allow for easy extension
 * ![63623] Calling !DataObjectDecorator->updateCMSFields() in !DataObject->getCMSFields() - was previously only called in !SiteTree instances
 * ![63620] Only list ID field in !DataObject->summaryFields() if no summaryfields are defined (or can be autodetected). Listing all fields was not feasible, as some subclasses have more fields than fits the column layout
 * ![63619] Added !ObjectTest->testSingletonCreation()
 * ![63615] Added !FieldSetTest->testRemoveTab()
 * ![63614] Updated translations from translate.silverstripe.com

 * ![63554] Checking for instanceof !DataObject instead of has_one() in !DataObject->update() to support virtual relations as well (fix to r63531)

 * ![63175] Introduced constants for system paths like /sapphire in preparation for a more flexible directory reorganisation. Instead of hardcoding your path, please use the following constants: BASE_PATH, BASE_URL, SAPPHIRE_DIR, SAPPHIRE_PATH, CMS_DIR, CMS_PATH, THIRDPARTY_DIR, THIRDPARTY_PATH, ASSETS_DIR, ASSETS_PATH, THEMES_DIR, THEMES_PATH

 * ![62841] Using optional $member parameter for !DataObject::can*() methods

 * ![62267] Added DBFieldTest to test prepValueForDB()
 * ![61685] You can now use Controller::join_links() to add querystring arguments to a URL

 * ![61618] wakeless - Added SQLQuery::filtersOnID()
 * ![61485] DropdownField now allows for <optgroup> elements in the field source by passing in a two dimensional array - this was taken from !GroupedDropdownField
 * ![61420] RequiredFields->php() uses quotes around title of field, falling back to the name of the field if title isn't available
 * ![61415] Added !LowerCase() to DBField to return the raw2xml converted value as lower case for any type of field if applicable
 * ![61394] Added !SetHeight() to the Image class, so we can call it from the templates
 * ![61392] Added !SetSize() to the Image class so we can use it in the templates

 * ![61154] Director::forceSSL() redirects are now 301 instead of 302 redirects, which is better for SEO
 * ![61153] ErrorPage:: should also list !ShowInSearch as 0, since it is not required to be searched
 * ![61149] Added getter method for !CompositeField->children
