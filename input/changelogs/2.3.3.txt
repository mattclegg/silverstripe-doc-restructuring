== 2.3.3 Changelog ==


=== New Features ===

 * ![81450] If referrer had spaces, they would be encoded as %20, which would cause problems when interpolated into an sprintf pattern. Inject instead.

 * ![79433] Object::add_extension() should only load statics for extensions of !DataObject, since it is specific to !DataObjectDecorator (Merged via: r81698)
