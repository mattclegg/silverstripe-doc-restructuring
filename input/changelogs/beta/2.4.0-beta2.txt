=== API Changes ===
 * [101155] Add option for !DataObjectDecorator::onAfterSkippedWrite()
 * [101137] Partial cache adjustments - now supports nested cache blocks (which are independant of their containing cache block), conditionals to control if a given cache block is active, and includes hash of template code in key (so template changes mean cache is invalidated). Changes template control for cache block to <% cached %>, to which the now deprecated <% cacheblock %> is aliased, and an additional template control <% uncached %> has been added.
 * [101127] Added !SiteTree::!VirtualPages() and !SiteTree::!DependentPages() accessors.
 * [101119] Allow on_db_reset() methods on !DataObjects as well as !DataObjectDecortators

 * [100842] Upgraded jQuery UI from v1.6rc1 (r687) to v1.8rc3. This release prefixes all *.js and *.css files with 'jquery', so ui.core.js is now called jquery.ui.core.js.
 * [100842] Upgraded jQuery UI themes from v1.6rc1 to v1.8rc3. Removed 'flora' and 'default' themes, replaced with the 'base' and 'smoothness' themes found in the default distribution
 * [100718] Removed "auto-merging" of member records from Member->onBeforeWrite() due to security reasons - please use !DataObject->merge() explicitly if this is desired behaviour (from r100705)
 * [100651] dbDataType function created
 * [100513] Refactored Requirements to use Requirements_Backend at all times - this makes testing far easier. Thanks tobych!
 * [100512] TreeDropdownField no longer requires your object to have the Hierarchy extension
 * [100503] Removed deprecated Email_Template class, please use Email instead!
 * [100498] Removed deprecated Image::loadUploaded() (deprecated from the parent::loadUploaded for which it called), please use Upload directly instead!

 * [100493] Removed deprecated function !RootURLController::get_homepage_urlsegment(), please use !RootURLController::get_homepage_link() instead!

 * [99849] SiteTree::validURLSegment extendable (#5907)
 * [99360] Date/time parsing in !DateField, !TimeField and !DatetimeField defaults to i18n::get_locale() ('en_US') instead of using en_NZ/en_GB specific parsing. Use i18n::set_locale('en_NZ') in mysite/_config.php to revert to old behaviour.
 * [99360] $timeformat constructor parameter in !TimeField needs to be in ISO date notation (not PHP's date())
 * [99360] TimeField, !DateField and related subclasses use Zend_Date for date parsing, meaning they're stricer than the previously used strtotime()
 * [99360] Removed DMYCalendarDateField and !CalendarDateField, use !DateField with setConfig('showcalendar')
 * [99360] Removed !CompositeDateField, DMYDateField, use !DateField with setConfig('dmyfields')
 * [99360] Removed !DropdownTimeField, use !TimeField with setConfig('showdropdown')

 * [99360] Changed 'date', 'month' and 'year' HTML field names to lowercase in DMYDateField

 * [99119] Refactor Versioned so a single state is kept for stage, archived date, or any module specific reading modes (from r98161)
 * [99114] Use the same navigator items in the CMS that are used on the frontend (from r97395)

 * [99051] Let any !DataObjectDecorator define an on_db_reset() method that is called by tests, like in Versioned. (from r97734)
 * [98786] Installer now uses a database configuration helper class which isolates the logic of checking the database away from the installer, this interface can be used by other databases like MSSQL and PostgreSQL. The installer now looks for a specific file inside each database module, provided it's configured in install.php MySQL is provided by default, as it lives in sapphire
 * [98543] Made !ComplexTableField not use Object::create() for item and popup classes to be consistent with !TableListField. These can be overridden as itemClass and popupClass are public properties on !ComplexTableField
 * [98373] HTTP::setGetVar() always returns absolute URLs. Use Director::makeRelative() to make them relative again.
 * [98373] HTTP::setGetVar() combines any GET parameters in PHP array notation (e.g. "foo[bar]=val") instead of replacing the whole array

 * [99777] #5087: Show default values in CTF 'add' popups.

 * [99711] Setting  ID explicitly in !MemberTableField-> to ensure getCsvQuery() correctly filters (the custom group filter was only implemented in sourceItems() before) (from r99684)
 * [99693] Changed sitetree default selection in !LeftAndMain.Tree.js to fire on window.load instead of document.ready() through entwine. We need to ensure behaviour.js bindings are available before
 * [99693] Automatically selecting root node in CMS trees (necessary because now we actually have forms on the root node, and its a valid click target) (from r99605)
 * [99679] really testing deletemarked now.
 * [99667] Fixed bogus HTMLEditorConfig instance when get() is called without a valid identifier (due to NULL database columns) (from r99599)
 * [99655] Fixed !TreeMultiselectField/!TreeDropdownField saving with 'unchanged' default values from constructor (from r99581)
 * [99647] Fixed !TreeMultiselectField->Field() to respect  settings, and give them priority over existing relations through getItems(). This is used in !MemberTableField to set default groups for 'add member' popups. (from r98879)
 * [99640] Fixed !DataObject->fieldLabels() to respect  flag (from r98748)
 * [99638] Folder::findOrMake() will create the assets/ folder if it's missing

 * [99572] Pages that you can't edit should always be grey, even if there are unpublished changes.
 * [99553] Remove buttons from display if you load a CMS page that should have no buttons - reverts bug caused by r96551 and fixes the issue it was trying to solve.
 * [99552] Fixed behaviour's ID selector matching when the ID is inside another context - eg 'body.className #ID'
 * [99522] Image::onBeforeDelete() now calls deleteFormattedImages() so resampled images in the filesystem are cleaned up
 * [99506] use the correct method for retrieving the report ID
 * [99490] tablename and columns quoted properly
 * [99479] Setting ID = -1 on Security/lostpassword to avoid showing toplevel navigation (see #5086)
 * [99465] Correct !StaticPublisher filenames, now works with nested URLS
 * [99443] batch_permission_check returns null rather than empty array when user has no permissions
 * [99394] Fixed variable existence checks in setValue() in !FormField::__construct() by checking for !== NULL (changed from isset($value) to $value in r99360)
 * [99391] Fixed !MoneyField constructor - parent (!FormField) constructor calls setValue() already, which needs to happen *after* setting certain field instances
 * [99342] Enforcing creation of temp database in !SapphireTest->setUp() to avoid writing to production databases. This check should only kick in for single test case runs, as the temp database connection should be set in a dev/tests/all run after the first db-related test anyway. (see #5034)
 * [99303] Disable some permission caching for now, as it was breaking unit tests (from r98504)
 * [99302] SiteTree::batch_permission_check() doesn't recurse with ID=0 calls

 * [99050] fix incorrect link in CMS (from r97408)
 * [99049] Make sure CMS link knows when its currently in the CMS (from r97403)
 * [99031] Don't show !FailedLoginCount field unless Member::$lock_out_after_incorrect_logins is enabled
 * [99005] Development server list should be retained when user submits installer form and gets redirected back
 * [98957] fix for #5076
 * [98946] the ID should be that of untranslated child (it's the middle segment that's from translated version, not the last one)
 * [98944] testing framework needs to be reset to a clean state after each test: now also nested urls and redirection state will be reverted
 * [98897] Fixed strpos() check in BASE_URL check
 * [98895] Installer now opens if mod_rewrite is disabled. Using index.php instead of rewriting the URL didn't quite work with the new BASE_URL, so we need to take this case into account as well
 * [98869] Fixed big problem on Windows when redirecting to install.php - because of SCRIPT_NAME backslashes caused a bit of havoc and need special treatment
 * [98860] restore the original nested_urls state after running the test, so we can enable and disable nested URLs within the tests safely.
 * [98853] Fixed URL generation in !TreeSelectorField.js, was failing to detect relative URLs - prefixing with <base> URL as a workaround
 * [98852] Added missing Requirements to !TreeDropdownField->Field() and !TreeMultiSelect->Field()
 * [98847] modified float to have the same database table schema as int. Now defaults to zero and 'not null'
 * [98777] Fixed quoting on !ContentController::successfullyinstaller() - this broke certain databases like PostgreSQL
 * [98776] #5053 Aggregate::query() should not set an orderby clause, otherwise databases will complain
 * [98694] columns quoted properly
 * [98693] Fixed !ManifestBuilder::has_been_included()
 * [98690] Closing TinyMCE image, link or flash panel when loading form (ticket #4907)

 * [98678] Fixed initial state of "use environment" checkbox in installer
 * [98671] fallback for changes in r98101, required if !TreeDropdownField is used in a widgetarea, and does not know its field
 * [98537] Fixed !ManifestBuilder::get_themes() not to assume an existing themes/ folder
 * [98536] Removed obsolete start argument from !ComplexTableField_Item constructor.
 * [98534] Make Security/login page's ID give a different number for loggedin vs loggedout, to help with partial caching
 * [98520] Fix virtual pages not returning correct content
 * [98448] Fixed missing third argument to !ComplexTableField_Item when the parent class instantiates it
 * [98434] Fixed infinite loop in FILE_TO_URL_MAPPING lookup when calling arbitrary scripts via CLI
 * [98432] Make login form work without any theme loaded.
 * [98403] Fixed Hierarchy->loadDescendantIdList() to call setOwner() on the extension instance. This was necessary due to underlying Object/Extension changes in 2.4.
 * [98382] #5044 Hierarchy::loadDescendantIDListInto() now uses Object::getExtensionInstance('Hierarchy') instead of going through __call(), as PHP 5.3 has issues converting references to values
 * [98373] HTTP::setGetVar() uses parse_url() and http_build_query() to add query parameters to an existing URL, instead of doing its own regex-based parsing. This means existing GET parameters are correctly url encoded.
 * [98324] Fixed !ContentController->deleteinstallfiles (added to $allowed_actions, see #5040)
