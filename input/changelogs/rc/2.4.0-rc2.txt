== 2.4.0-rc2 Changelog ==

=== Overview ===

 * Improved permission handling in the "Security" section: "Access to all CMS sections" not automatically checks all inherited permissions
 * Fixed usage of file, image and link selection in the CMS with multilingual sites (Translatable)
 * Fixed core unit tests for PostgreSQL
 * Fixed a core bug in PostgreSQL concerning the ordering and grouping of DataObjectSet results
 * Allowing the new "SiteConfig" interface to save TinyMCE content, enabling easier usage of default content which doesn't belong to a single page
 * Updated api.silverstripe.org to accurately reflect the current API in different releases, with a nightly rebuild to keep it that way

=== Features and Enhancements ===
 * [103730] use !FileSystem class to create cache directory to unsure the right permissions are set
 * [103710] MemberLoginForm::performLogin() now uses the authenticator_class variable set in subclasses of !MemberLoginForm, without having to overload performLogin()
 * [103708] create cache directory when it does not exist before running the cache build test
 * [103581] Added i18n::set_default_locale() to set standard locale (which is different from "current locale" retrieved through i18n::get_locale())
 * [103466] make the getTree ajax call more generic so it get local from its containing form, rather than hard-coded "Form_!EditForm_Locale" cos the field is not only used in "!EditForm"
 * [103465] to make the !FileIFrameField and !TreeSelectionField easy to use in CMS with Translatable on.
 * [103328] Automatically checking all "CMS section" checkboxes in !PermissionCheckboxSetField.js when "Access to all CMS interfaces" is selected. Saving these permissions individually also resolves certain edge cases like #5438.
 * [103250] added tests for checking the change password functionality, including the resulting redirection (from #5420)
 * [103229] allow !ChangePasswordForm to redirect to BackURL (from #5420)
 * [103198] allow onAfterPublish and onBeforePublish handlers directly on Page classes (#5112)
 * [103047] allow to check for any changed fields on the !DataObject, this is expected behaviour when isChanged function is called without parameters (#5421, patch by walec51)
 * [102899] added language (Ticket #5390)


=== API Changes ===
 * [103792] changed the modulus offset to 1 to correctly order sets


=== Bugfixes ===
 * [103803] Rebuilding test database for postgresql in !SearchFormTest and !TranslatableSearchFormTest to avoid stale index information in the database
 * [103745] static publisher for a site that resides in a subfolder of webroot

 * [103706] Use correct quoting for !BrokenLinksReport (ticket #5474)
 * [103674] #5485 !PermissionCheckboxSetField javascript would always uncheck all CMS_ACCESS_* permission checkboxes on initialize event

 * [103612] Ensure that group by of many-many queries with extraFields is set correctly.

 * [103588] #5362: Fixed duplicate removal on !DataObject:get() with join argument for all databases.
 * [103582] Choosing i18n::default_locale() in Member->populateDefaults() instead of "current locale". This fixes a bug where a new member created through admin/security automatically "inherits" the current locale settings of the admin creating it.
 * [103552] CSSContentParser now reports better errors by using simplexml_load_string() instead of !SimpleXMLElement directly
 * [103519] Prevent duplicate HTML IDs in !ModelAdmin
 * [103518] Fixed redirection in !PageCommentInterface to use Link() instead of URLSegment (fixes 4200, thanks ktauber)
 * [103461] Renamed Nested URLs are automatically redirected to their new location with 301 HTTP status code in !ModelAsController/!ContentController (fixes #5393, thanks cbarberis)

 * [103341] Don't show error when adding default !SiteConfig records after upgrading a site.

 * [103255] static publishing now uses the last non-null theme, OR the value defined in !StaticPublisher::static_publisher_theme.
 * [103240] r101093 broke casting of values from the failover object. Add lookup to the failover for casting info, and add test
 * [103226] made the invalid password message translatable; disallow new blank password (as it makes it impossible to login); Member::checkPassword now returns !ValidationResult - handle that properly (#5420, patch submitted by walec51)
 * [103214] the decorator was not completely removed, which caused trouble for tests running later in the same batch
 * [103183] default sort column now quoted
 * [103182] default sort column now quoted
 * [103127] realtime publishing now enabled by default
 * [103099] Only replace double slashes in SS_HTTPRequest->__construct() for relative- its a failsafe against wrongly formatted URLs like 'admin//assets' instead of 'admin/assets', but breaks absolute URLs with 'http://' prefix
 * [103092] disallow numeric actions - numeric array indexes are incorrectly picked up as allowed actions (#5331)
 * [103083] make the javascript-producing functions behave in the same way. Now they will return a javascript snippet and the caller is responsible for adding it to a !FormResponse. Removes the duplication in AJAX response which happened when !FormResponse::add has been used before the call to JS helper functions (#5359)
 * [103037] correct mollom field mapping
 * [103012] added optional separator for http_build_query in HTTP:setGetVar(). this fixes sorting columns in !ModelAdmin (ticket #5325).

 * [102712] Fixed CTF sorting in !ModelAdmin results (was failing because of missing '!ResultAssembly' GET parameters
 * [102686] Float should always be not null and default 0 in the database
 * [102545] Using i18n::get_locale() in !ContentController->!ContentLocale() to ensure the correct locale can be used in templates withouth Translatable enabled (broken in r97207, thanks !DesignCity) (from r102544)
 * [102460] #5316 Float and Double should never try to save NULL as the "null" value
 * [102436] #5320 !ManyManyComplexTableField::getQuery() now uses T-SQL compatible syntax CASE WHEN instead of IF THEN which works in multiple databases as well

 * [102074] Fixed !SiteTree::page_type_classes() to exclude '!SiteTree' even if on array position 0 - slight difference in return values from Postgres to MySQL (fixes #5336)
