== 2.4.1-rc1 Changelog ==

=== Overview ===

 * Fixed a security issue where logged-in CMS authors were allowed to rename files with harmful extensions in the "Files & Images" section
 * Improved installer security by disallowing re-installation when a configuration file is already present. 
 * Installing in "live mode" instead of "dev mode" by default, and avoid setting certain domains as "dev mode" by default. This fixes an issue where attackers were able to force a site into "dev mode" by spoofing the domain name on certain server configurations.
 * Fixed password encryption when saving members through the "Add Member" dialog in the "Security" admin. The saving process was disregarding password encyrption and saving them as plaintext (issue was introduced in 2.4.0)
 * Fixed potential information disclosure on misconfigured servers by disallowing direct execution of *.php files in "sapphire", "cms" and "mysite" folders. If PHP was configured to show errors on screen (development setting), attackers could find out server paths and other environment information.
 * Allow CMS authors to set their own localized date and time formats, independently from the defaults set through their interface language.
 * More useable date picker (jQuery UI) for date form fields (both in the CMS and in website forms)
 * Better URL "transliteration" of special characters like Umlauts or Macrons (Example title: "Brötchen für alle!", URL in 2.4.0: "brtchen-fr-alle", URL in 2.4.1: "broetchen-fuer-alle")
 * Better batch editing of comments in the admin interface (e.g. marking multiple comments as "spam")
 * More sophisticated access control for decorators on page types (tri-state permissions checks: allow, deny, ignore).

 * [107273] Don't reflect changes in File and Folder property setters on filesystem before write() is called, to ensure that validate() applies in all cases. This fixes a problem where File->setName() would circumvent restrictions in File::$allowed_extensions (fixes #5693)
 * [107273] Removed File->resetFilename(), use File->updateFilesystem() to update the filesystem, and File->getRelativePath() to just update the "Filename" property without any filesystem changes (emulating the old $renamePhysicalFile method argument in resetFilename())

 * [104669] Moved site tree permission extension to a 3-state system (true, false, null, where null means "no effect")
