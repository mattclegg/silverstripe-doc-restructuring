=== Overview ===

 * Bugfix release for a minor MySQL 4 bug as well as some static publishing quirks

=== Bugfixes ===
 * [103961] Bypass static caching through static-main.php when GET or POST parameters are set (regression from 2.3 API, fixes #5519, thanks ktauber)
 * [103960] Fixed publication of homepage with '/' URL through !StaticPublisher (fixes #5514, thanks ktauber)
 * [103957] Fixed Database->requireTable() for Mysql 4.1 (fixes #5517, thanks gw0)

 * [103912] Trimming expected output of !WebserverRoutingTest (newlines before the "ok" string were causing failures on PHP 5.3)
 * [103910] Disabled !MemoryLimitTest for environments where memory_limit can't be freely set (e.g. PHP with suhosin patch)
 * [103851] table and column names now quoted properly


=== Minor changes ===
 * [103975] Removed unnecessary $timeformat parameter from !TimeField::__construct, and getting the default from Zend_Locale_Format in the same way that !DateField behaves (unreleased API, so no api change).
 * [103975] Automatically choosing $locale in !TimeField::__construct, to be consistent with !DateField
