== 2.4.0-rc1 Changelog ==


=== Features and Enhancements ===
 * [101871] Updated automatic regression tests (Salad)
 * [101670] RedirectorPage ExternalURL field now defaults to http:// to be consistent with the "Another website" option for !HtmlEditorField !LinkForm
 * [101661] tidied up installer process to streamline process. Moved requirements to top and button to bottom and added visual seperation of the individual steps
 * [101381] refactored requirements section to hide successful tests
 * [101378] Added links to installation introduction text for sources of help and suggested web hosts
 * [101246] Improved wording and styling in installer. Added links to server requirements, themes download, tutorial. Decreased vertical space before the "install" button to make it more obvious.
 * [101127] Added 'Dependent pages' tab to CMS, to show virtuals, redirectors, and backlinks that point to this page.


=== API Changes ===
 * [102012] Changed !MySQLFulltextSearchable class to !FulltextSearchable (applies to all databases)
 * [102003] Disallow methods/actions in !RequestHandler->checkAccessAction() which are implemented on parent classes (e.g. !ViewableData and Object), unless access is controlled through $allowed_actions. This limits information exposure from getters used in template contexts.
 * [101833] Allow cached blocks within control and if blocks, as long as that control or if block is contained within an uncached block, not a cached block
 * [101155] Add option for !DataObjectDecorator::onAfterSkippedWrite()
 * [101137] Partial cache adjustments - now supports nested cache blocks (which are independant of their containing cache block), conditionals to control if a given cache block is active, and includes hash of template code in key (so template changes mean cache is invalidated). Changes template control for cache block to <% cached %>, to which the now deprecated <% cacheblock %> is aliased, and an additional template control <% uncached %> has been added.
 * [101127] Added !SiteTree::!VirtualPages() and !SiteTree::!DependentPages() accessors.

 * [102004] Prevent handling of controller actions which return $this avoid infinite loops in !RequestHandler->handleRequest (thanks Hamish!)
 * [101975] Resetting image sidepanel fields when opening the panel instead of inserting an image, to avoid losing focus of TinyMCE in IE. Using getBookmark() in TinyMCE to save the original location. (fixes #5263)

 * [101739] Versioned->publish() with $createNewVersion=TRUE now increases version number of in-memory object (fixes #5261)
 * [101737] RedirectorPage types shouldn't appear in "Pages with no content" side report in the CMS Pages tab
 * [101724] #5277 Sort of default !SiteTree records is now explicitly set to avoid strange ordering set by !SiteTree::onBeforeWrite for default records

 * [101711] Don't replace "home/" URLSegment in !SiteTree->!RelativeLink() if Translatable is enabled and the homepage is not on the root level (nested URLs allows you to have homepages called "en/home" and "ru/home") (fixes #5244)

 * [101602] IE does not accept TD element without a table, repacking into DIV (open #5228)
 * [101592] get a object inside transaction block will alway exist

 * [101227] Don't delete index.php after successful installation - in !ContentController->deleteinstallfiles(). URL routing might rely on it without mod_rewrite.
