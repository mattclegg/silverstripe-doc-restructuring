=== Installing SilverStripe on an existing Nginx server ===

**These instructions are also covered on the [[http://wiki.nginx.org/SilverStripe|Nginx Wiki]]**


The prerequisite is that you have already installed Nginx and you are able to run PHP files via the FastCGI-wrapper from Nginx.

Now you need to setup a virtual host in Nginx with the following configuration settings:

<code>
server {
        listen   80;
        server_name  yoursite.com;

        root   /home/yoursite.com/httpdocs;
        index  index.html index.php;

        if (!-f $request_filename) {
                rewrite ^/(.*?)(\?|$)(.*)$ /sapphire/main.php?url=$1&$3 last;
        }

        error_page  404  /sapphire/main.php;

        location ~ \.php$ {
                fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
                fastcgi_index  index.php;
                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /home/yoursite.com/httpdocs$fastcgi_script_name;
                include fastcgi_params;
        }
}
</code>

The above configuration will setup a new virtual host ''yoursite.com'' with rewrite rules suited for SilverStripe. The location block at the bottom will pass all php scripts to the FastCGI-wrapper.

Now you can proceed with the SilverStripe installation normally.
