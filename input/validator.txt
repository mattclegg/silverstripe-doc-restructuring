 ====== Introduction ====== 
Validator is the base class of all serverside-validation. It also controls inclusion of clientside-valiation (through //Validator.js//).


====== Usage ======
Validators are implemented as an argument to the [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/core/Form.html|Form]] constructor.  You create a required fields validator like so.  In this case, we're creating a [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/sapphire/form/RequiredFields.html|RequiredFields]] validator - Validator itself is an abstract class.
<code php>
$validator = new RequiredFields("Email","FirstName");
return new Form($this, "FormName", $fields, $actions, $validator);
</code>

To create your own validator, you need to subclass validator and define two methods:
  * **javascript()** Should output a snippet of JavaScript that will get called to perform javascript validation.
  * **php($data)** Should return true if the given data is valid, and call $this->validationError() if there were any errors. 
 
===== Disable JavaScript Validation =====
By default, SilverStripe forms with an attached Validator instance use the custom Validator.js clientside logic. It is quite hard to customize, and might not be appropriate for all use-cases. You can disable integrated clientside validation, and use your own (e.g. [[http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation|jquery.validate]]).

Disable for all forms (in mysite/_config.php):
<code php>
Validator::set_javascript_validation_handler('none');
</code>

Disable for a specific form:
<code php>
$myForm->getValidator()->setJavascriptValidationHandler('none');
</code>
