==== Code Example ====

Here is a simple implementation of a Tab. Obviously, you can include as many fields inside as you want, and you can include other tabs, too!

<code php>
new Tab(
	$title='Tab one',
	new HeaderField("A header"),
	new LiteralField("Lipsum","Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet enim.")
)
</code>
