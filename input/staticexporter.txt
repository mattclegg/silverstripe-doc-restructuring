===== Introduction =====
This class lets you export a static copy of your site as a tar.gz archive.

See [[StaticPublisher]] for a more versatile solution for deploying static content (incl. publishing to multiple content servers).
===== Requirements =====
  * Unix-Environment (does not work on Windows)

===== Usage =====
Usage through URL:
<code>
http://localhost/StaticExporter/export
</code>

Usage on commandline (through [[sake]]) is not possible at the moment, as we're sending a file to the browser for download.

Specify a custom baseurl in case you want to deploy the static HTML pages on a different host:
<code>
http://localhost/StaticExporter/export?baseurl=http://example.com
</code>
