===== Introduction =====
Shows a group of [[Member]] as a editable tabular list (similiar to [[ComplexTableField]]). It's more useful when you want to display additional fields from a [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/sapphire/model/DataObject.html|DataObject]]. Moreover, you can add permissions to the table such as show and export

You can also do a search in the table and use the popup window to navigate from Member to Member.

See [[ForumRole]] for an example of a [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/sapphire/model/DataObject.html|DataObject]].

See [[ComplexTableField]] for more documentation on the base-class

===== Source Input =====
See [[Member]] for the defaults fields viewable in the table.

===== Setting Additional Permissions =====
MemberTableField contains by default the add, edit and delete permissions.  You can add the other permissions from a _config.php file :
<code php>
MemberTableField::addPermissions( array( "show", "export" ) );
</code>

===== Setting Additional Fields =====
MemberTableField contains some static functions which allows you to add decorator fields to your table. You can call the functions from a _config.php file :
<code php>
MemberTableField::addMembershipFields( array( 
	"Nickname" => "Nickname",
	"Occupation" => "Occupation",
	"Country" => "Country",
	"ForumRank" => "ForumRank"
	));
</code>

===== Export As CSV =====
By default, if you don't specify a second array in the static function, the csv file will contain the same fields as the table. In our previous example, if you don't want the ForumRank field in your csv file :
<code php>
MemberTableField::addMembershipFields( array( 
	"Nickname" => "Nickname",
	"Occupation" => "Occupation",
	"Country" => "Country",
	"ForumRank" => "ForumRank"
	), array( 
	"Nickname" => "Nickname",
	"Occupation" => "Occupation",
	"Country" => "Country"
	));
</code>

===== Using The Search Functionality =====
The search field is to do a research in the table content (and also the fields that have been added). If you want to reload the full table content, just do an empty research.

NB : The export functionality exports the table content, so you can export a research result if you want.
