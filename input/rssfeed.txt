====== Introduction ======
Generating RSS/Atom-feeds is just a matter of rendering a [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/sapphire/model/DataObject.html|DataObject]] and the Page Comment Interface.

RSSFeed doesn't limit you to generating "article-based" feeds, it is just as easy to create a feed of your current staff-members. The only logical limitation here is that every item in the RSS-feed should be accessible through a URL on your website, so its advisable to just create feeds from subclasses of [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/cms/SiteTree.html|SiteTree]].

====== Usage ======
===== Showing latest Blog posts =====
  * The first part will add an appropriate link tag for autodetecting RSS feeds
  * The second part sets up /this-page/rss to return the RSS feed.  This one returns the children of the current page.

<code php>
	function init() {
		RSSFeed::linkToFeed($this->Link() . "rss", "RSS feed of this blog");
		parent::init();
	}
	
	function rss() {
		$rss = new RSSFeed($this->Children(), $this->Link(), "My feed", "This is an example feed.", "Title", "Content", "Author");
		$rss->outputToBrowser();
	}
</code>

===== Example of showing the 10 most recently updated pages =====


You can use RSSFeed to easily create a feed showing your latest Page updates. Just change mysite/code/Page.php to something like this:
<code php>
<?php
class Page extends SiteTree {
	static $db = array(
	);
	static $has_one = array(
   );
}

class Page_Controller extends ContentController {

	// Gets the Project Name
	function project() {
		global $project;
		 return $project;
	}	

	function init() {
		RSSFeed::linkToFeed($this->Link() . "rss", "10 Most Recently Updated Pages");
		parent::init();
	}
	
	function rss() {
		$rss = new RSSFeed($this->LatestUpdates(), $this->Link(), "10 Most Recently Updated Pages", "Shows a list of the 10 most recently updated pages.", "Title", "Content", "Author");
		$rss->outputToBrowser();
	}

	function LatestUpdates() {
		// 10 is the number of pages
		return DataObject::get("Page", "", "LastEdited DESC", "", 10);
	} 
}

?>
</code>
====== Viewing Comment RSS Feeds ======
You can view RSS feeds for comments for a certain page or for all comments on your site by visiting http://www.yoursite.com/PageComment/rss . That produces a RSS Feed of the most recent comments to all of your site. You can also do http://www.yoursite.com/PageComment/rss?pageid=46 where pageid is the id of the page you want to follow


====== External Sources ======
RSSFeed only creates feeds from your own data. We've included the [[http://simplepie.org|SimplePie]] RSS-parser for accessing feeds from external sources.
