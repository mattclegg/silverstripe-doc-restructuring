====== Third-party Packages used in SilverStripe CMS ======

Included in these installers are a number of third-party packages.  We couldn't have made SilverStripe without the support of these tools, thank you to every one of the developers involved in these projects.

Where possible, these libraries around found in /sapphire/thirdparty/ inside the SilverStripe package.

== License Policy == 

Because SilverStripe is released under the BSD license, we strive for such components to follow suite. Sometimes this isn't possible and so we will accommodate other popular OSI-approved open source licenses, such as the LPGL. In particular, SilverStripe should not bundle "stronger" licensed software such as GLP packages.

== Being notified of upgrades to third party packages ==

We have prepared a Yahoo Pipes RSS feed of the updates to TinyMCE, SWFUpload, jQuery, and SimplePie, so that we can be notified when updates to these packages are available. This is useful for security vulnerabilities as well as to learn of improvements to those packages.

  * Pipes page: http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=zrnJFBEN3hGsIjCYwTSbTQ
  * RSS: http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=zrnJFBEN3hGsIjCYwTSbTQ&_render=rss

Other packages aren't included in this pipe, either because they are deprecated from SilverStripe's perspective and so we're not interested in upgrades, or, in the case of the testing frameworks, because they're not bundled with SilverStripe.
