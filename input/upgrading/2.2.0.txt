====== Upgrading to SilverStripe 2.2.0 ======

=== Changelog ===
See [[http://open.silverstripe.com/wiki/ChangeLog/2.2.0|full changelog]]

=== General ===

== Login Form ==
Check that you have a Layout/Page.ss file for your site, or alternately have a Security_login.ss template.
Your template file needs a $Form variable for it to work. This is where the login form gets included. Without either of these, the Security/login form will be blank.


== Form Actions HTML/CSS ==
Check css/js and subclassed templates of Form.ss for changed markup. A global search for "p.Actions" should cover both js/css changes.
<code html>
// before
<p class="Actions">
// after
<div class="Actions">
</code>
See http://open.silverstripe.com/changeset/43562

== Form Security Token ==
There has been a hidden 'SecurityID' field added to SilverStripe generated forms by default, with the purpose to stop CRSF attacks. If you wish your form not to be tied to a specific session, and able to be able to be executed by URL without the SecurityID, you can disable it on your form with
<code php>
$form->disableSecurityToken();
</code>

The other issue to be aware of is constructing the URL to execute the form manually, as is done in javascript sometimes. If the security token is enabled, you need to add its value to the URL, eg:
<code js>
updateURL += ($('SecurityID') ? '&SecurityID=' + $('SecurityID').value : '');
</code>

== Custom Section in CMS ==
Special attention will need to be given to custom sections on a case-by-case basis.

As we have changed the design of the CMS, the top bar for your custom sections is no longer needed. We've moved the buttons that it once held down to the bottom.
