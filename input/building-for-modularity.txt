====== Building for modularity ======

This page discusses what we need to do to let us easily insert add-on modules into SilverStripe sites, without any fuss.  For example, the biggest piece of work when adding a forum to your site should be choosing the right colours ^_^


More information on actually building a module can be found [[creating-modules|here]].


===== Templates =====
  * Build them as a theme - [[themes|go here]] for more information.
  * Ensure that your template includes layout inside the following div: <div id="Layout">$Layout</div>
  * Ensure that your Layout templates only include content that could be totally replaced by a forum, event management system, or e-commerce engine.  It might be infeasible to do this 100%, but remember that every piece of navigation that needs to appear inside $Layout will mean that you have to customise templates when integrating the module, meaning more work for you.


===== CSS =====
  * Give div#Layout a defined width, so that modules can style themselves inside this. 


===== Module design =====

  * All of your templates should be Layout templates
  * You can assume that <div id="Layout"> will be created, and that it will have its width set appropriately.
  * Make all of your CSS flexible width - % based: The Layout div could be any width.
  * Don't include any navigation elements in your Layout templates, keep it focused on just the stuff for that module.
  * Break down your templates into groups of includes.  Site integrators would then have the power to override individual includes, rather than entire templates.
