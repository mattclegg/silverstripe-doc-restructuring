===== What does it mean to be a module maintainer? =====

One of the best ways that you can contribute to SilverStripe is by developing a module for SilverStripe.  If you do, we would love to host your module and have you become an official module maintainer on our site. Please read our [[http://silverstripe.org/contributing-to-silverstripe/|"Contributing to SilverStripe"]] overview.

Once you have created a module, login at silverstripe.org and submit it at http://silverstripe.org/modules/manage/add

===== What do we expect? =====

It's very important to us that users of SilverStripe can come to expect a level of quality from the core product and any modules running on it. 
In order to provide this, we require certain things from module maintainers.
==== Code ====

  * Put your code in version control (you can get a [[http://subversion.trigris.org|subversion]] or [[http://git-scm.com/|git]] repository for free at [[http://code.google.com|code.google.com]], [[http://github.com|github.com]] etc.)
  * Follow our [[coding-conventions]]
  * Write unit tests and functional tests covering code bundled with the module - see [[testing-guide]]
  * Ensure your code is [[i18n|localizable]] and [[translation|translatable]]

==== Documentation ====

  * Follow our [[documentation-guidelines]]
  * Add your module to [[http://silverstripe.org/modules|silverstripe.org/modules]] (and keep the version compatibility information current)
  * Include a ''README'' file at the root level of your module with maintainer contact information, requirements, installation instructions, and a link to your module wiki page.
  * Include a well-maintained ''changelog'' which should be updated with every release
  * Optional: Add a wiki page on [[http://doc.silverstripe.org|doc.silverstripe.org]] with user- and developer documentation (see [[modules:forum]] for a good example)

==== Maintenance ====

  * Prepare releases as detailed in [[module-releases]] ([[http://producingoss.com/en/development-cycle.html|more info]])
  * Ensure that your module is patched to always work with the latest SilverStripe release, and note these compatibilities on your modules page on silverstripe.org
  * Be involved in our community 
    * Subscripe to our developer mailing list and be available to answer questions on the forum. 
    * Attend [[irc:our weekly core discussions on IRC]] as regularly as you can.
  * Create an ''issue tracker'' so your users can file bugs and feature requests, and keep track of their status (we can provide you with a new category on [[http://open.silverstripe.org]])
  * Create a ''roadmap'' and ''milestones'' outlining future release planning

==== Principles ====

  * Strive for features you add to the CMS to be innovatively usable by a content editor rather than a web-developer. Think Wordpress and Apple.
  * Strive for the module to work merely by placing the code in your SilverStripe installation and running /dev/build. Provide a default set of configuration options that are easily changed in _config.php (For instance the ecommerce module works out of the box, and you can easily set up a payment provider), aiding a pleasant user experience.
    

===== What do you get? =====

In return for all your hard work in putting a high-quality module on the site, we will give you the following:

  * Use of [[http://open.silverstripe.org|trac]] to keep your bugs and feature requests organised
  * Advertising of your module on the http://silverstripe.org/modules/ modules page once it has reached a beta stage and shown to meet our requirements above.
  * We might showcase your module on our blog and/or newsletter, when it's first released and/or when a major version with significant new features is released. We'll work with you to publicise it on other blogs too (it helps if you deliver screenshots and screencasts)
  * More influence in suggesting changes to the core product
  * Kudos on Ohloh ( See http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5034?p=SilverStripe+CMS )
