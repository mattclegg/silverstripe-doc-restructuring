====== Simple Wiki Module ======

The simple wiki module has been built to bring a wiki style editing interface to content in a SilverStripe managed site. Some key features include

  * Edit wiki pages on the frontend of the site using any of the following editors
    * TinyMCE wysiwyg (including link and image selection)
    * MarkItUp
    * Plain text entry
  * Basic wiki markup supported
  * Use wiki style tags to create new subpages eg [[New Page Name]]
  * Choice of editing workflow; edit content -> save and auto publish or edit -> save draft -> explicitly publish
  * Page locking to prevent multiple people editing the same content
  * Creating of new pages from the frontend
  * WYSIWYG plugins for linking to images and cms pages via the frontend (functional, not pretty...)

Functionality still to be developed in later releases for this module includes 

  * Auto save functionality
  * Improve the wiki rendering engine to support more complete wikimedia syntax
  * Allow non-logged in users to edit pages
  * Integrate some form of spam detection for page edits
  * Page diff and version rollback
  * Automatic upload of images/files

====== Getting Started ======

===== Requirements =====

  * SilverStripe 2.4


===== Configuration Options =====

Within the CMS, you can change the editor used on a per page basis. This is done by setting the "Editor Type" value on the "Behaviour" tab of the page in question. Note that this setting inherits down the tree of pages. 

From your mysite/_config.php page, you can set the following values which affect behaviour also 

  * WikiPage::$show_edit_button = true; Whether to show the "Edit Page" button to users who aren't logged in (thus triggering the login process)
  * WikiPage::$auto_publish = true; Whether pages are automatically published whenever they are saved. If this is NOT true, then page edits only affect the 'Stage' view of the site, and must be explicitly published (a button is available for this from the frontend). Note also that it means that newly created pages are only available in the 'Stage' view of the site too, even though the published content might refer to them. By default, pages are automatically published as per normal wiki behaviour. 


===== Quick Start =====

  * Login to the CMS
  * Create a page of type Wiki Page in the site root called "Wiki"
  * Navigate to the page on the frontend and click "Edit Page"
  * Enter content and click "Save" (which continues editing) or "Finished" which will return you to the rendered content

===== Be aware of... =====

  * Users that can edit the content are determined by whether they can edit the content in the backend CMS (ie there's no special frontend editing role as yet). 
  * Public editing isn't possible at the moment
  * Frontend user registration has to be a roll-your-own solution for now - we're looking at building a separate profile management module that can be used by many modules instead of explicitly adding it to the simplewiki module.
