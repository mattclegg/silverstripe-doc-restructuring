===== External Content quick start guide =====

This article assumes that you have installed the "FileSystem Connector" module (http://public.silverstripe.com.au/open/modules/filesystem-connector/), which provides access to content from a filesystem path. 

===== Configuration Options =====

  * FileSystemContentSource::$base_path - Set a filesystem path that is the root path for any connector created (eg Folder Path is relative to the path entered here)

===== Connecting to the content source =====

  * Browse to http://localhost/external-content/admin and login
  * Create a new FileSystemContentSource from the tree on the left menu. Set the 
following field values:
    * name - File System Content
    * Folder Path - The folder to retrieve content from (in the form /path/to/content)
  * Once saved, you will need to reload the External Content page for content to start coming through the connector

===== Accessing content on the frontend =====

  * Navigate to the "Site Content" tab
  * Create a new 'External Content Page' in your site tree
  * Change the External Content Source value to the source created earlier
  * Save and view the page on the frontend; its url should look something like http://localhost/extcon/view?ID=1 or similar
  * You can also link to external content directly in the WYSIWYG content areas by selecting "External Content" as the "Link To" option when the Insert Link toolbar is displayed

===== Importing content ===== 

  * First, make sure you have an empty folder called "Incoming" created in the "Files & Images" section
  * Navigate back to the External Content section, and expand the "File System Content" node created earlier. 
  * Navigate to a folder that contains some files and click on its name, then click on the Migrate tab.
  * Select the "Incoming" folder, then click the "Include Selected Item in Migration" option.
  * Click the Migrate button down the bottom. An alert box will shortly appear when the migrate is complete. 
  * Navigate to the "Files and Images" section and click the "Incoming" folder. 
  * The uploaded files should appear in the right hand listing when you select the imported folder
