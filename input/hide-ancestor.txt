 If you're making a page type to replace an existing class, you don't want CMS authors to be able to create pages of the original type.

You can set the **$hide_ancestor** static variable to the name of the class that you're replacing, and it will no longer be listed in the "create page" dropdown.

For example, in PerweekProduct.php:


<code php>
  class PerweekProduct extends Product{
  // do not show the given ancestor in CMSMain.AddPageOptionsForm, and potentially elsewhere too.
  static $hide_ancestor = "Product";
  static $db = array(
	"RRP" => "PerweekCurrency",
         ...
