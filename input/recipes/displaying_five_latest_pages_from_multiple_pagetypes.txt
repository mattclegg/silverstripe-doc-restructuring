====== Overview ======
[[http://doc.silverstripe.com/doku.php?id=tutorial:2-extending-a-basic-site|tutorial:2-extending-a-basic-site]] gives us a great method for [[tutorial:2-extending-a-basic-site#showing_the_latest_news_on_the_homepage|showing the latest news on the homepage]]. But what if you have a Latest News section and a Client News section, and you want to display 5 of the latest of EITHER kind of news?

Well, here's what you'd use:

<code php>
function LatestNews() {
	$articles = DataObject::get("Page", "`ClassName` IN ('ArticlePage', 'ClientArticlePage')");
	$articles->sort("Date", "DESC");
	$returnarticles = $articles->getRange(0, 5);
	
	return $returnarticles;
}
</code>
====== What's happening here? ======
Let's go through it line by line: 
  * The first line creates a new DataObject called $articles that gets all the pages with a ClassName of either ArticlePage or ClientArticlePage. This differs from the original method used in Tutorial 2 because it will pickup ANY of these page types, irrespective of the Parent page.
  * The next line then sorts the DataObject (from largest to smallest; newest to oldest) by the field called 'Date' (This assumes you have added a Date field to the above pagetypes. If you haven't, you can use something like "Created" instead of "Date" which is available on all pagetypes). 
  * The third line uses getRange to limit the DataObject, to in this instance 5 pages, before saving it as $returnarticles. 
  * Finally we return $returnarticles so that we can use <% control LatestNews %> in the template to control the DataObject.

====== Other uses ======

  * Combining the children of multiple pages into a feed that can be displayed on a separate page.
  * Merging two DataObjects, Combining two DataObjects (layman's terms for searching).
