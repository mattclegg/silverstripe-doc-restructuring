Some of our clients like to rebrand the CMS.

In SilverStripe 1, we had a lot of control in places where it wasn't really necessary.  In SilverStripe 2, I've focused the rebranding support on the areas where it's actually useful.

  * The name of the application, with the exception of help.
  * The logo / name in the top-right.

LeftAndMain has two methods that help with this:

  * LeftAndMain::setApplicationName("something"): This will change the name of the application to "something".  As much as possible, this name is used throughout the system.
  * LeftAndMain::setLogo("http://www.something.com/my-logo-file.gif", "padding-left: 50px"): This will use my-logo-file.gif as the logo instead.  It needs to fit into a bar 48px high.  The second argument lets you specify additional CSS attributes to the logo element, to get the logo positioned correctly.  Note that when you set a logo, the application text in the top-right disappears.
   * LeftAndMain::set_loading_image('somepath/something.gif'): This will set the loading screen used between AJAX requests in SilverStripe

==== Rebranding configurations ====

Add the following to _config.php
<code php>
LeftAndMain::setApplicationName("Cube CMS");
LeftAndMain::setLogo("http://test.totallydigital.co.nz/logos/cube-logo.jpg", "position: relative; left: 5px; margin-top: -3px; padding-left: 50px;");
