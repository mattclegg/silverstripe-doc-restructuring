====== Customizing the Default Theme ======

if you are using Silverstripe 2.4.0 and later, you should read [[http://doc.silverstripe.org/siteconfig|this page]]

On older versions of Silverstripe, you couldn't change the site title from the CMS by default. This was a design feature of SilverStripe, to keep the CMS lighter from configuration. If you are using an older version of Silverstripe, this recipe is still valid.

Changing the site name and tag line is pretty simple with the default theme. You just need to open one file with your standard text editor (NotePad, TextMate etc) and swap out the title. If you are using the blackcandy theme, you would go to 

** themes/blackcandy/templates/Page.ss (about line 25-27) **

and edit the code shown below.

<code html>
		<div id="Header">
	   		<h1> | Enter your Site Name | </h1>
	    	        <p> | Enter your tagline or leave blank | </p>
		</div>
