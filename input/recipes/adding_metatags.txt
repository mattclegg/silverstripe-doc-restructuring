====== how to add your own custom Meta Tags ======
If you are looking at building several sites and you want to add your own custom meta tags by default, then you can use something like the code below to achieve this. 

Usually, you would add $MetaTags to the header of your Page.ss template.  You can add further Meta Tags by adding $MetaTagsCustom to your template and then adding the following class to your php code:

<code php>

<?php
Class MetaTags extends DataObjectDecorator {

 static $country = "New Zealand";
 static $copyright = 'owner';
 static $design = '';

 function MetaTagsCustom() {
  $page = $this->owner;
  $tags = '
 <meta name="copyright" content="'.self::$copyright.'" />
 <meta name="coding" content="YOUR NAME HERE" />
 <meta name="design" content="'.self::$design.'" />
 <meta name="country" content="'.self::$country.'" />
 <meta http-equiv="imagetoolbar" content="no" />
 <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
 <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />';
  return $tags;
 }
}

</code>

The $page variable is added in case you would like to use some of the variables from the page (e.g. $page->Title will give you the Title of the page).

Next, you have to edit your _config.php file:

<code php>
DataObject::add_extension('SiteTree', 'MetaTags');
MetaTags::$copyright = "My Uncle";
MetaTags::$design = "My Sister";
etc...
</code>

Using this method ensures that you can keep all the Silverstripe functionality (even when upgrading to a new version) while adding your own to it.
