==== Upgrading ====
=== 0.1 to 0.2 ===
We undertook some major API changes. To help you migrate from 0.1 to 0.2 we have included a build task which you can run which will go through your installed forms and rebuilt them with the new 0.2 datamodel.

To run this build task you visit the url - http://www.yoursite.com/dev/tasks/UserFormsMigrationTask
