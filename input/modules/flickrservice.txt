Flickrservice provides you the ability to interact with the popular photo-sharing site [[http://www.flickr.com|Flickr]] from your SilverStripe based site. FlickrService class gives you access to the Flickr API via its RESTful interface, allowing you to play with Flickr photos. Based on FlickrService, we've included two ready made components under this module. Those are :
