==== Adding an Album ====

All images must go into an album. By default, a new ImageGallery page creates "Default Album" for you to start adding images. You may modify its title or leave it as is. Saving the album will create its folder in:

// assets/ImageGallery/MyImageGalleryPage/MyAlbum //

==== Adding Images ====

After having created the albums you wish to use, you may add Images to them on the //Photos// tab. Select the album you wish to upload to in the dropdown menu on the right-hand side. If your album does not appear or if the list is outdated, hit the //refresh// button.

Click the "Add Images to [Album Name]" button, and go through the upload/import process. If an image comes in with the wrong aspect ratio, use the //Rotate// feature.

After you have uploaded all of your images, you can manage them in the ImageGalleryManager. Use the image resizing tool to get a closer look at your images, or to give it a more macroscopic view.

==== Single-Album Galleries ====

If you only have one album in your gallery, the ImageGalleryPage will bypass the album view and go straight to your album view.
