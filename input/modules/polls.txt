====== Poll Module ======

The Polls module provides a interface for adding polls like that from tutorial 3 http://doc.silverstripe.com/doku.php?id=tutorial:3-forms in the backend so creating and viewing results can be done via the backend.

===== Download =====
  * [[http://open.silverstripe.com/changeset/latest/modules/polls/tags/0.1?old_path=/&filename=/modules/polls/tags/0.1&format=zip|0.1]] (Latest Release)
  * [[http://open.silverstripe.com/changeset/latest/modules/polls/trunk?old_path=/&filename=/modules/polls/trunk&format=zip|Daily Build]] ("trunk")

===== Installation ===== 
If you are running SilverStripe 2.3 or later then you will also need to install the [[modules:genericdataadmin]] module.

Once you have checked out the module visit yoursite.com/db/build?flush=1 to rebuild the database then reload the CMS. You should now have a Polls Section in the CMS.

===== How to Use =====
There is 2 steps in creating a poll on a site. You first need to create a poll in the CMS. Then you need to add a method to your Site to create a new ShowPoll class.

==== Creating a Poll in the CMS ====
  - Hit create poll in the top left of the screen
  - Enter the Poll Details in the right hand pane. Enter the Poll Title and the Various answers you will allow the user to select.
  - Hit Save in the bottom right once you are done to save your poll.
  - If you want your poll to show on the site (rather then being archived) tick the Is this Poll Active checkbox under Poll Details

==== Showing the Poll On the frontend ====

Depending on which page you want to add the poll, you need to add a method which returns a new ''ShowPoll'' class with 2 constructors - the Controller and the name of the Poll. 

For example I have added this method to mysite/code/Page.php 

<code php>
class Page_Controller extends ContentController {
 ...
 function MyPoll() {
    return new ShowPoll($this, 'MyPoll');
 }
 ...
}
</code>

Then all you need to do is open up your template file (in my case this is Sidebar.ss in themes/myteheme/templates/Includes/) and add the following code 

<code html>
$MyPoll
</code>

This will render the method we added to our Page.php file (MyPoll()) which in turn will create a new ShowPoll() which will render one of our Polls randomly.

===== To Do =====
  * Nice Graph based reporting
  * Admin UI Improvements

===== ChangeLog =====
  * 0.1 - Initial Stable Release. Includes support for creating polls and rendering a random poll on a page
