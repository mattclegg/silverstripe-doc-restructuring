====== Introduction ======
This module facilitates community-driven translations through a web-based interface. It supports multiple translators, upload of lang-files for your own modules, a simple approval workflow and a frontend for viewing translation-status. You can see it in action on http://translate.silverstripe.com.

**Currently in private alpha-testing**

FIXME Add download-link once translation module is released
