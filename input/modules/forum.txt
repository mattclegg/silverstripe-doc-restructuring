===== Extending Forum Members =====
A Forum Member is created by adding new fields to a Member thanks to the [[:dataobjectdecorator|DataObjectDecorator]] file.

This fields can be edited by each member who logs in. Moreover, the user has the possibility to make public or not his personal details.

If you want to customize the details of a forum member and be able to see them even in the CMS part, you have to do several modifications :

Create the file /mysite/code/CustomForumRole.php and add the following functions :
<code php>
<?php

class CustomForumRole extends DataObjectDecorator {

function extraStatics() {
  // To modify the fields of the database
}

function getForumFields() {
  // To modify the forum member form (registration) of the forum
}

function updateCMSFields() {
  // To modify the forum member view of the popup window in the CMS part
}
}
?>
</code>

And to point this file to override the forum member you need to set in /mysite/_config.php:
<code php>
DataObject::add_extension('Member', 'CustomForumRole');
</code>

===== Topic And Post =====
When you begin a topic, add a post or edit one, you have the possibility to :
  * Format your post using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bbcode|BBCode]] (some codes exist on these forums that aren't noted on the Wikipedia article).
  * Attach files
  * Suscribe to the topic.
