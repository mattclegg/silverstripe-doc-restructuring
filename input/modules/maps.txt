=== Installation ===

1. Rename the extracted directory to "maps" and place in the root of your silverstripe installation.
Your directory structure should like this now:

assets
mysite
cms
jsparty
maps


2. In order to use the Google Maps module you require an API-key from Google.
You can easily obtain one from the following URL : http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
Place your API key in the file "maps/_config.php" 
  
  $GMaps_API_Key = 'ABQIAAAA15yRnC3laEBteiFmGHGwlBT2yXp_ZAY8_ufC3CFXhHIE1NvwkxSoRGI9YhLOfvLYGE3U8oDVf-Esgw';


3. Run /db/build/
