====== Spam Protection ======

The Spam Protection module provides the core code to cover your site forms with spam protection methods such as Captcha.

You will need to install an additional spam protector module to make use of this functionality. 

By default Spam Protection provides protection for Page Commenting on pages and in the blog.

===== Requires =====
  * SilverStripe 2.3.2


===== Download =====
  * [[http://silverstripe.org/spam-protection-module/|Spam Protection Module homepage]] (Stable version)
  * [[http://open.silverstripe.com/changeset/latest/modules/spamprotection/trunk?old_path=/&filename=/modules/spamprotection/trunk&format=zip|Daily Build]] ("trunk")


===== Installation =====
To make use of the Spam Protection module you need to complete two steps.

First you will need to download and install this module, and secondly you will need to download a Spam Protector Module such as [[modules:mollom|Mollom]] to make use of it.

To install this module:

1. Unzip the file listed under downloads inside your SilverStripe installation directory. It should be at the same level as 'jsparty', 'cms' and 'sapphire' modules. (You will later need to do the same with the Spam Protector subclass such as [[modules:mollom|Mollom]].) For more information on installing a module see [[installing-modules]]

2. Ensure the directory name for the module is 'spamprotection'. 

3. Visit your SilverStripe site and run http://yoursite.com/dev/build

5. We now need to setup some basic features to get the module up and running. Open up  'mysite/_config.php' with your favourite text editor.

6. The MollomSpamProtector is the name of the second module you downloaded. This tells the SpamProtection module that you want to use 'MollomField' as a spam protection module across your site. Add this code to your _config.php

<code php>
SpamProtectorManager::set_spam_protector('MollomSpamProtector');
</code>



===== Using Spam Protector in your Custom Forms =====

Once you have spam protector installed then your page comments form as well as your forum signup page have the build in protection. If you want to add protection to your own custom form the following code needs appear after the form creation. 

<code php>
// your existing form code
$form = new Form(....

..
// add this line
SpamProtectorManager::update_form($form, null, array('Title', 'Content', 'Name', 'Website', 'Email'));

</code>

This code adds an instance of a 'SpamProtectorField' class specified in Installing Section (in this case 'MollomSpamProtector'). The newly created field will have a MollomField field. The first parameter is a Form object in which the field will be added into and the second parameter tells SpamProtectorManager to place the new field before a field or not and the third is the fields to map spam checking to

In the second line we tell the spam protector what fields we want covered by the protector.

Other configuration options are avaliable through update_form() as well 

<code php>
// API Reference
SpamProtectorManager::update_form($form, $fieldToAppearBefore, $fieldsToMap, $titleOfCaptcha, $rightTitleOfCaptcha);
</code>

===== Making Your Module Spam Protection Enabled =====

If you are a module author and looking to provide hooks into your modules forms without requiring spam protection (eg its there as an enhancement) you can wrap the SpamProtector call in a class_exists() call

<code php>
// your existing form code
$form = new Form(....

// Optional Spam Protection.
if(class_exists('SpamProtectorManager')) {
	SpamProtectorManager::update_form($form, null, array());
}
</code>

If the user has spam protection enabled then your forms will be able to support it.
