== Installation on Windows using Web Platform Installer ==

{{http://doc.silverstripe.com/assets/windows.png }}
(Windows XP, 2003, 2008, Vista and 7)

== Installing SilverStripe ==
  * Download and run Microsoft Web Platform Installer (WebPI):
[[http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appsxml=www.microsoft.com%2fweb%2fwebpi%2f2.0%2fWebApplicationList.xml&amp;appid=105|{{http://www.silverstripe.org/assets/downloads/webpi/wpiBadgeGreen.png}}]]

  * In WebPI, select 'SilverStripe' from the 'Content Management System' link
  * Select install. It will install dependencies like the Microsoft SQL Server database, as well as PHP (if you don't have these installed already). You can alternatively choose MySQL as a database in the setup wizard.
  * Type in the questions it asks you, such as the username/password you set in the above database installation:
  * Everything should be installed, with you seeing the initial webpage
  * And you can log-in to the CMS

== Important: Installation issue on XP ==

After you've installed SilverStripe on XP using WebPI. You'll need to make a configuration change to get it working.

Specifically, you need to configure XP not to check that a script file exists before executing the script.  This is necessary for URLs of the form http://localhost/silverstripe/index.php/about-us/ to work.

  * Open IIS Administrator
  * Expand the local computer tree node
  * Expand the Web Sites tree node
  * Right click on "Default Web Site" and select "Properties"
  * Select the "Home Directory" Tab.
  * Click the "Configuration Button towards the bottom on the right
  * Select the "Mappings" Tab
  * Find the .php mapping, select it and click the "Edit" button
  * Make sure the check box "Check that file exists" is cleared.
  * Hit OK's all the way back up and restart IIS
