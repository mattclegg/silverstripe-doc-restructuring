====== How to install SilverStripe ======

SilverStripe is a web application.  This means that you will need to have a web server meeting SilverStripe's  [[server-requirements|requirements]] running.

The installation instructions below will take you through setting up an appropriate web server on your system.  The installation instructions will set you up with a SilverStripe website very similar to our [[http://demo.silverstripe.com/|our demo site]] uses. 

=== Windows ===

If you run Windows, we recommend that you use [[installation-on-windows-pi|Microsoft's free Web Platform installer]]. If you are more technically inclined you can install using [[installation-on-windows-wamp|Apache on Windows]] or [[installation-on-windows-manual-iis|Manually install on IIS]].
=== Mac OS X ===

If you run Mac OS X, we recommend that you install MAMP first, and then install SilverStripe.

If you run into trouble, see [[common-problems]] or post to [[http://www.silverstripe.com/silverstripe-forum/|the SilverStripe forum]].

If your installation does not allow PHP short tags i.e. you must have <%php, there is a bug in the current install package (2.3.1, 20 March 2009) that prevents Silverstripe installing. See this [[http://silverstripe.org/installing-silverstripe/show/256795?start=0|forum thread]] for details and how to fix it.

For advanced set-ups, see these pages.  These describe our the core SilverStripe team manage their own projects:
