This tells you how to access the CMS when you've forgotten your password, and when you cannot use 'reset password function.' (E.g. if your email is different/unknown.). It requires file-system/FTP access to the website.

You cannot actually retrieve your current password, only set it to something new.

  - Edit your mysite/_config.php
  - Add the following line, replacing 'username' and 'password' with something temporary.<code>
Security::setDefaultAdmin('username', 'password');
</code>
  - Log in to the CMS (http://www.yourwebsite.com/admin ) using the username and password above.
  - You are now logged in as one of the admin accounts stored in the system.
  - Visit the Security section of CMS.
  - Edit or add Administrator accounts as appropriate to set credentials you can then use. You cannot retrieve the password; only set it to something new.
  - Test you've resolved the situation. Log out and then log in as an administrator account you've created/restored.
  - Remove the line from step 2 in _config.php. This removes the potential backdoor.
