====== Installation on Windows using WAMP (Apache webserver) ======

{{http://doc.silverstripe.com/assets/windows.png }}

An easy and reliable approach to getting SilverStripe running on Windows is to use Apache, which can be convieniently done through [[http://www.wampserver.com/en/|WampServer]]. This can be useful if you are deploying on Linux Apache and want a Microsoft Windows machine with a very similar environment.

  * Note: Installing on Microsoft's IIS webserver is likely to be easier - See [[installation-on-windows-pi]]

== Installing using WampServer ==
  * [[http://www.silverstripe.org/assets/screencasts/silverstripe-installation-wamp/index.html|Watch as video.]]

  - Download WampServer from http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php
  - Run the installer.  By default, it will install to C:\wamp.  You can choose your own install path if you wish; the directories mentioned below will also be different.
  - Once WampServer has been installed and launched, you will see a little half circle gauge in the task bar, next to the clock.  If everything is working, then it will be white.  If it's yellow or red, then something is wrong.  If you can't see the gauge, then WampServer hasn't been started and you should start WampServer from the start menu.
  - If something's wrong, this usually means that you have another service on port 80 or port 3306.   Here are some common sources of problems to check.  After correcting these issues, left-click the gauge and choose 'restart all services'.  It might a short while to restart, but the gauge should go to white.
    * You might have IIS running.  Check Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services.   Ensure that any web site services are stopped.
    * If you run Skype, visit Select "Tools" -> "Options" in Skype's menu.  Find an option "Use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connection".  Make sure that it is de-selected.
  - Left-click the gauge, then select Apache -> Apache Modules -> Rewrite Module.  The gauge will flick to yellow, and then return to white.
  - Left-click the gauge, then select MySQL -> my.ini. At the very bottom of the file, and add the following to a new line (without the quotes): "lower_case_table_names = 2". Save the file, close Notepad and left-click the gauge, and selected 'Restart all services'. This is used to ease the transition between a Windows-based install and a Linux-based install where case-sensitivity is important.
  - [[http://silverstripe.org/download|Download]] the latest SilverStripe installer package
  - Unpack the archive into C:\wamp\www
  - Rename the unpacked directory from C:\wamp\www\silverstripe-vX.X.X to C:\wamp\www\silverstripe
  - Visit http://localhost/silverstripe - you will see SilverStripe's installation screen.
  - You should be able to click "Install SilverStripe" and the installer will do its thing.  It takes a minute or two.
  - Once the installer has finished, visit http://localhost/silverstripe.  You should see your new SilverStripe site's home page.

=== Troubleshooting ===

If it didn't go to plan, you can try the following things:

  * If you get an error after clicking the "Install SilverStripe" button, try visiting http://localhost/silverstripe/db/build?flush=1 and then going back to http://localhost/silverstripe
  * If you see the install screen when visiting http://localhost/silverstripe after installation, then check the file permissions on c:\wamp\www and update them so that everyone can edit files in there.

== Vista ==

Vista's security controls can cause issues. If you have installed on Vista but you're getting errors, there is a chance that SilverStripe does not have sufficient permissions.

Right clicked on the installation folder and go to Permissions > Security > Users > Advanced and give the user full control. 

//This could use refinement!//

=== Advanced features ===

You don't need to do things things just to get SilverStripe going, but they can help you set up a more sophisticated development environment.

== TortoiseSVN ==

I use [[http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/|TortiseSVN]] to mnage my SVN repos - gives me nice icons inside Windows Explorer and let's you commit/update etc easily. I like it better than Eclipse because it's a little more graphical but your mileage may vary.

== Virtual hosts ==

Virtual hosts let you run multiple sites on different domain names from your windows machine.

  - Open httpd.conf and uncomment the line at the bottom of the file that includes httpd-vhosts.conf
  - Open httpd-vhosts.conf and delete all the current stuff in it
  - Leave (or-recreate) the "NameVirtualHost" line, remove :80 if it exists (so the line now reads "NameVirtualHost *" without quotes
  - Make this your default (it must be the very first <VirtualHost> block in the file to be classed as the default)
<code>
##
## Site list, phpMyAdmin, WAMP-specific config etc.
##
<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot C:/serveweb/sites/default
    ServerName localhost

    CustomLog ../logs/default/access.log common
</VirtualHost>
</code>

  - Add extra ones for each project you work on. For example:
<code>
##
## ssopen
##
<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot c:/serveweb/sites/ssopen
    ServerName ssopen
    CustomLog ../logs/ssopen/access.log common
</VirtualHost>

##
## uPlay
##
<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot c:/serveweb/sites/uplay
    ServerName uplay
    CustomLog ../logs/uplay/access.log common
</VirtualHost>
</code>

  - Create directories inside the logs/ folder for each project (you can remove the line, but it helps to debug issues when Apache doesn't like what you're passing it)
  - Create these directories. What I find works well is to install TortiseSVN, open c:\serveweb\sites, then right click and select SVN Checkout. Add the project name to the end of the destination directory and modify the SVN source path to suit. It'll check out the project into c:\serveweb\sites\uplay, for example.
