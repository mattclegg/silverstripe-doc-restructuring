====== Introduction ====== 
Form is the base class of all forms in a sapphire application. Forms in your application can be created either by instantiating the Form class itself, or by subclassing it. See [[recipes:forms|our form recipes]] for more specific information.

====== Creating a form =======

===== By instantiation =====
Creating a form is a matter of defining a method to represent that form.  This method should return a form object.  The constructor takes the following arguments:
  * ''$controller'': This must be the controller that contains the form.
  * ''$name'': This must be the name of the method on that controller that is called to return the form.  The first two fields allow the form object to be re-created after submission.  **It's vital that they are properly set - if you ever have problems with form action handler not working, check that these values are correct.*
  * ''$fields'': A [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/core/FieldSet.html|FieldSet]] containing all the [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/core/Form.html|Form]]s that make up the editable portion of the form.
  * ''$actions'': A [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/core/FieldSet.html|FieldSet]] containing all the [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/core/Form.html|Form]]s that make up the control portion of the form - the butons at the bottom.
  * ''$validator'': An optional [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/validators/Validator.html|Validator]] object to define form validation.  Form validation is done on a per-form basis, rather than per-field basis.  See [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/validators/Validator.html|Validator]] for more information.

<code php>
function MyCustomForm() {
	$fields = new FieldSet(
		new EmailField("Email"),
		new EncryptField("Password")
	);
	$actions = new FieldSet(new FormAction("login", "Log in"));
	return new Form($this, "MyCustomForm", $fields, $actions);
}
</code>

===== By subclassing =====
It's the reponsibility of your subclass' constructor to call 
<code php>
parent::__construct()
</code>
with the right parameters.  You may choose to take $fields and $actions as arguments if you wish, but $controller and $name must be passed - their values depend on where the form is instantiated.

<code php>
class MyForm extends Form {
	function __construct($controller, $name) {
		$fields = new FieldSet(
			new EmailField("Email"),
			new EncryptedField("Password")
		);
		$actions = new FieldSet(new FormAction("login", "Log in"));
		
		parent::__construct($controller, $name, $fields, $actions);
	}
}
</code>

The real difference, however, is that you can then define your controller methods within the form class itself.
====== Form Field Types ======
There are many classes extending [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/core/FormField.html|FormField]]. Some examples:

  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/TextField.html|TextField]]
  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/EmailField.html|EmailField]]
  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/NumericField.html|NumericField]]
  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/DateField.html|DateField]]
  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/CheckboxField.html|CheckboxField]]
  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/DropdownField.html|DropdownField]]
  * [[http://api.silverstripe.org/current/forms/fields-basic/OptionsetField.html|OptionsetField]]

===== Using Form Fields =====
To get these fields automatically rendered into a form element, all you need to do is create a new instance of the class, and add it to the fieldset of the form. 
<code php>
$form = new Form(
        $controller = $this,
        $name = "SignupForm",
        $fields = new FieldSet(
            new TextField(
                $name = "FirstName", 
                $title = "First name"
            ),
            new TextField("Surname"),
            new EmailField("Email", "Email address"),
         ), 
        $actions = new FieldSet(
            // List the action buttons here
            new FormAction("signup", "Sign up")
        ), 
        $requiredFields = new RequiredFields(
            // List the required fields here: "Email", "FirstName"
        )
);
</code>

You'll note some of the fields are optional.

Implementing the more complex fields requires extra arguments.

<code php>
$form = new Form(
        $controller = $this,
        $name = "SignupForm",
        $fields = new FieldSet(
            // List the your fields here
            new TextField(
                $name = "FirstName", 
                $title = "First name"
            ),
            new TextField("Surname"),
            new EmailField("Email", "Email address")
            new DropdownField(
                 $name = "Country",
                 $title = "Country (if outside nz)",
                 $source = Geoip::getCountryDropDown(),
                 $value = Geoip::visitor_country()
            )
        ), new FieldSet(
            // List the action buttons here
            new FormAction("signup", "Sign up")
 
        ), new RequiredFields(
            // List the required fields here: "Email", "FirstName"
        )
);
</code>

====== Readonly =====

Readonly on a Form
<code php>
$myForm->makeReadonly();
</code>

Readonly on a FieldSet
<code php>
$myFieldSet->makeReadonly();
</code>

Readonly on a FormField
<code php>
$myReadonlyField = $myField->transform(new ReadonlyTransformation());
// shortcut
$myReadonlyField = $myField->performReadonlyTransformation();
</code>

====== Using a custom template ======
//Required Silverstripe 2.3 for some displayed functionality//

You can use a custom form template to render with, instead of //Form.ss//

It's recommended you only do this if you've got a lot of presentation text, graphics that surround the form fields. This is better than defining those as //LiteralField// objects, as it doesn't clutter the data layer with presentation junk.

First of all, you need to create your form on it's own class, that way you can define a custom template using a ''forTemplate()'' method on your Form class.

<code php>
class MyForm extends Form {

   function __construct($controller, $name) {
      $fields = new FieldSet(
         new TextField('FirstName', 'First name'),
         new EmailField('Email', 'Email address')
      );

      $actions = new FieldSet(
         new FormAction('submit', 'Submit')
      );

      parent::__construct($controller, $name, $fields, $actions);
   }

   function forTemplate() {
      return $this->renderWith(array(
         $this->class,
         'Form'
      ));
   }

   function submit($data, $form) {
      // do stuff here
   }

}
</code>

''forTemplate()'' tells the Form class to render with a template of return value of ''$this->class'', which in this case is //MyForm//, the name of the class. If the template doesn't exist, then it falls back to using Form.ss

//MyForm.ss// should then be placed into your //templates/Includes// directory for your project. Here is an example of basic customisation:

<code html>
<form $FormAttributes>
   <% if Message %>
      <p id="{$FormName}_error" class="message $MessageType">$Message</p>
   <% else %>
      <p id="{$FormName}_error" class="message $MessageType" style="display: none"></p>
   <% end_if %>
   
   <fieldset>
      <div id="FirstName" class="field text">
         <label class="left" for="$FormName_FirstName">First name</label>
         $dataFieldByName(FirstName)
      </div>

      <div id="Email" class="field email">
         <label class="left" for="$FormName_Email">Email</label>
         $dataFieldByName(Email)
      </div>

      $dataFieldByName(SecurityID)
   </fieldset>

   <% if Actions %>
      <div class="Actions">
         <% control Actions %>$Field<% end_control %>
      </div>
   <% end_if %>
</form>
</code>

''$dataFieldByName(FirstName)'' will return the form control contents of ''Field()'' for the particular field object, in this case ''TextField->Field()'' or ''EmailField->Field()'' which returns an ''<input>'' element with specific markup for the type of field. Pass in the name of the field as the first parameter, as done above, to render it into the template.

To find more methods, have a look at the Form class, as there is a lot of different methods of customising the form templates, for example, you could use ''<% control Fields %>'' instead of specifying each field manually, as we've done above.

==== Form Security ====
SilverStripe tries to protect users against //Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)// by adding a hidden //SecurityID// parameter to each form. See [[secure-development]] for details.

====== Best Practices ======


===== Remove existing Form Fields =====
If you want to remove certain fields from your subclass:

<code php>
class MyCustomForm extends MyForm {
	function __construct($controller, $name) {
		parent::__construct($controller, $name);
		
		// remove a normal field
		$this->fields->removeByName('MyFieldName');
		
		// remove a field from a tab
		$this->fields->removeFieldFromTab('TabName', 'MyFieldName');
	}
}
</code>

===== Add single field to existing tab =====
Adds a new text field called FavouriteColour next to the Content field in the CMS
<code php>
$fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Content.Main', new TextField('FavouriteColour'), 'Content');
</code>


===== Add a Dropdown to Page-class =====
Here is an example of adding a drop-down to your page allowing choosing of colors:

<code php>
class Page extends SiteTree {

   static $db = array(
      'PageColor' => 'Varchar(6)'
   );

   protected static $colors = array(
      'FFCC66' => 'Orange',
      '9999CC' => 'Blue',
   );

   function getCMSFields() {
      $fields = parent::getCMSFields();
      $fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Content.Main', new DropdownField('PageColor',
 'Page Color', self::$colors), $this->PageColor);
      return $fields;
   }

}
</code>

Instead of putting the array directly into the arguments for the new DropdownField object, we have a static array which can be easily modified later on if necessary. You then call ''self::$colors'' to fetch this array for the DropdownField object when created. Storing any dropdown-maps directly on a class can be adviseable if you might need to access those values somewhere else. It is also easier to document, and overwrite from external functionality.
