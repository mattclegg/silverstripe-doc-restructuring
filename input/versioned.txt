==== Trapping the publication event ====
Sometimes, you'll want to do something whenever a particular kind of page is published.  This example sends an email whenever a blog entry has been published.

//SilverStripe 2.3//
<code php>
class Page extends SiteTree {
  // ...
  function publish($fromStage, $toStage, $createNewVersion = false) {
    mail("sam@silverstripe.com", "Blog published", "The blog has been published");
    return $this->extension_instances['Versioned']->publish($fromStage, $toStage, $createNewVersion);
  }
}
</code>

//SilverStripe 2.4//
<code php>
class Page extends SiteTree {
  // ...
  function onAfterPublish() {
    mail("sam@silverstripe.com", "Blog published", "The blog has been published");
    parent::onAfterPublish();
  }
}
</code>
