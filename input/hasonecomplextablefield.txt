===== Introduction =====
This [[RelationTable]] allows you to show a **1-to-1** or **1-to-many** relation with a group of DataObjects as a (readonly) tabular list (similiar to [[ComplexTableField]]). Its most useful when you want to manage the relationship itself thanks the **radio buttons** present on each line of the table.

Moreover, you have the possibility to uncheck a radio button in order to make the relation as null.

See [[ComplexTableField]] for more documentation on the base-class.

See [[HasManyComplexTableField]] for more documentation on the relation table base-class.

===== Construction =====
It works exactly in the same way than [[ComplexTableField]] :
<code php>
$tablefield = new HasOneComplexTableField(
    $this,
    'MyOnlyFruit',
    'Fruit',
    array(
	'Name' => 'Name',
	'Color' => 'Color'
    ),
    'getCMSFields_forPopup'
);
</code>

**Notice** : You still have different ways to customize the popup window as in the parent-class [[ComplexTableField]].

This [[RelationTable]] is made to manage a **has_one** relation. In the SilverStripe [[datamodel|relation system]] between DataObjects, you can use this relation for **1-to-1** and **1-to-many** relations.
By default, a //HasOneComplexTableField// manages a **1-to-many** relation. If you want to specify that the relation that you manage is a **1-to-1** relation, add this code :
<code php>
$tablefield->setOneToOne();
</code>

===== Customizing The Add Title =====
You can change the add title value by using this code :
<code php>
$tablefield->setAddTitle( 'A Fruit' );
</code>

===== Example =====
To see an example of the //HasOneComplexTableField// table, follow this [[tutorial:5-dataobject-relationship-management|tutorial]].
