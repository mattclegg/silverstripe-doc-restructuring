You or your client may need information about how we strive to keep SilverStripe secure.  Here is a 
statement that you can use.

==== Security benefits of open source and SilverStripe ====

Transparency is the main reason open source software can be more robust than proprietary systems.  In a closed source model, customers must rely on one vendor to identify, diagnose and issue a patch, which can be a lengthy process.

SilverStripe, on the other hand, has a community of nearly 2,000 developers, only 11 of which are Silverstripe employees.  Members of this community are constantly reviewing and testing the software, developing fixes and sharing patches. If a security flaw is made known, all members have an interest in finding a quick solution.

The developer community publishes security patches on our community forum and our open project management tool at http://open.silverstripe.com. Once a patch is developed and reviewed, it is incorporated into subsequent releases.

SilverStripe is dedicated to keep the SilverStripe CMS software secure using best practice techniques, reviewing and improving the code constantly.  All code is reviewed for security before it becomes part of the SilverStripe core.

In particular, SilverStripe advocates implementing security as a part of the data layer, rather than in the interface.  This means that people cannot side-step insecure interfaces to access data that they don't have access to.

Government agencies using open source benefit from a broad user community in the commercial space that is committed to maintaining security.  More quickly deployed patches mean a shorter period in which a government agency is vulnerable to attack.
