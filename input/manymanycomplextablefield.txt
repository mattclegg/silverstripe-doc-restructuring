===== Introduction =====
This [[RelationTable]] allows you to show a **many-to-many** relation with a group of DataObjects as a (readonly) tabular list (similiar to [[ComplexTableField]]). Its most useful when you want to manage the relationship itself thanks to the **check boxes** present on each line of the table.

See [[ComplexTableField]] for more documentation on the base-class.

See [[HasManyComplexTableField]] for more documentation on the relation table base-class.

**Note:** This class relies on the fact that both sides of the relation have database tables. If you are only creating a class as a logical extension (that is, it doesn't have any database fields), then you will need to create a dummy static $db array because SilverStripe won't create a database table unless needed.

===== Construction =====
It works exactly in the same way than [[ComplexTableField]] :
<code php>
$tablefield = new ManyManyComplexTableField(
    $this,
    'MyFruits',
    'Fruit',
    array(
	'Name' => 'Name',
	'Color' => 'Color'
    ),
    'getCMSFields_forPopup'
);
</code>

**Notice** : You still have different ways to customize the popup window as in the parent-class [[ComplexTableField]].

===== Customizing The Add Title =====
You can change the add title value by using this code :
<code php>
$tablefield->setAddTitle( 'A Fruit' );
</code>

===== Example =====
To see an example of the //ManyManyComplexTableField// table, follow this [[tutorial:5-dataobject-relationship-management|tutorial]].
