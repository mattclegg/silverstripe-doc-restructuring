====== Introduction ======
A single database record & abstract class for the data-access-model. The ability to add comments to a page is optional for **all pages in SilverStripe**.


===== Spam Protection =====
==== Math Question ====
Adding MathSpamProtection::setEnabled() to _config.php enables the spam protection question for creating comments within SilverStripe. An example question is "What is four plus five?". The question automatically updates if the question is answered right or wrong.


==== Akismet ====
The SSAkismet class provides spam detection for comments using [[http://akismet.com/]]. In order to use it, you must get an API key, which you can get free for non-commercial use by signing up for a [[http://www.wordpress.com|WordPress]] account. Commercial keys can be bought [[http://akismet.com/commercial/|here]].

To enable spam detection, set your API key in _config.php.  The following lines should be added to **mysite/_config.php** (or to the _config.php in another folder if you're not using mysite). 

<code php>
SSAkismet::setAPIKey('insertkeyhere');
</code>

If you want to save spam into the database so you can review them later, enable it in _config.php like so:

<code php>
SSAkismet::setSaveSpam(true);
</code>

You can then view spam for a page by appending //?showspam=1// to the url.

==== Mollom ====
See [[modules:mollom]] for instructions on how to add Mollom to your page comments form.

===== Comment Administration =====
There is a new 'Comments' administration area in the CMS. Comments are seperated into three tables - Approved, Awaiting Moderation, and Spam. The table allow mass deletion and reclassification of comments. By default all comments not detected as spam go into the Approved folder. You can add the line "PageComment::enableModeration();" into the _config.php to enable moderation, which means all new comments go into the Awaiting Moderation folder. Comments awaiting moderation will not be shown on the front end page unless the user is an administrator.
