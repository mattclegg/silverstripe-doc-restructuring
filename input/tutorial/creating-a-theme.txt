====== Overview ======

This is a short tutorial demonstrating how to quickly create your own theme for a SilverStripe site. While it is recommended that you have completed the earlier tutorials, you should be able to simply copy/paste your way through this. You can add the theme to a fresh install or to the tutorial site.

====== Note ======

This tutorial is in the early development stage. Please do not edit until I finish it ;)
