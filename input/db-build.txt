SilverStripe has a powerful tool for automatically building database schemas.  We've designed it so that you should never have to build them manually.

To access it, visit (site-root)/dev/build?flush=1.  This script will analyze the existing schema, compare it to what's required by your data classes, and alter the schema as required.  

Put the ?flush=1 on the end if you've added PHP files, so that the rest of the system will find these new classes.

It will perform the following changes:

  * Create any missing tables
  * Create any missing fields
  * Create any missing indexes
  * Alter the field type of any existing fields
  * Rename any obsolete tables that it previously created to _obsolete_(tablename)

It **won't** do any of the following

  * Deleting tables
  * Deleting fields
  * Rename any tables that it doesn't recognize - so other applications can co-exist in the same database, as long as their table names don't match a SilverStripe data class.
