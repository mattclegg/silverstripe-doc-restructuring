====== Member GroupSet ======

This is a special kind of [[#ComponentSet]] which has special functions for managing subscription based information and other membership -> newsletter based subscriptions.

==== Saving Member Newsletter Relationships ====
You can automatically create and generate a way to save all membership types by using DataObject::get("NewsletterTypes"); to generate the source for a [[#CheckboxSetField]]

<code php>
$fields->push(
	new CheckboxSetField("NewsletterSubscriptions","Receive email notification of events in ",
		$source = DataObject::get("NewsletterTypes")->toDropDownMap();
		$member->Groups()->Map()
	)
);
</code>


Then in the handler function you can get the field from the form data: 
<code php>
	/** Save the newsletter groups **/
	$groups = $member->Groups();
	$checkboxfield = $form->Fields()->fieldByName("NewsletterSubscriptions");
	$groups->setByCheckboxSetField($checkboxfield);
</code>

The function setByCheckboxSetField() takes the field and updates the appropriate groups (adds and removes) for you. 

This functionality is quite useful for managing subscriptions (which you have to provide by law - privacy act - in New Zealand if your using Email as a marketing tool).
