====== ImageField ======
A field that will upload attached images.

{{:imagefield.png|:imagefield.png}}


===== Choosing a Folder =====

If you want to upload all assets from this field to a given folder you can define the folder in 2 ways. Either in the constructor or as a method on the field

<code php>
$myField = new ImageField("myName", "Upload image below", null, null, null, "myFolder");
</code>

Will upload images into the assets/myFolder folder. If that folder does not exist it will create it for you. You can also define it as a method

<code php>
$myField = new ImageField("myName");
$myField->setFolderName('myFolder');
</code>
