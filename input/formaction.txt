**FormAction_WithoutLabel**

==== Example use ====

If you want to implement a [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/forms/core/Form.html|Form]] into a form element, you need to pass it an array of source data.

Upon clicking the button below will redirect the user to //doAction// under the current controller.

<code php>
new FormAction (
   // doAction has to be a defined controller member
   $action = "doAction",
   $title = "Submit button"
)
</code>

==== Labels ====
By Default **FormAction** will use the title as the label for the left margin.  This can look redundant on the form.  If you'd rather have just the button alone with as pictured above try using **FormAction_WithoutLabel** instead.
