  * Documentation lookup on selected word (ctrl+h) in api/doc.silverstripe.com

==== Download over SVN ====
You can simply copy the files into your TextMate preferences directory.
<code>
svn co http://svn.silverstripe.com/open/tools/textmatebundle/trunk "~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles"
</code>

===== ACK Fulltext Search =====
ACK is the "better grep" for TextMate: Ignores hidden folders like //.svn// and binary files, has easier to understand options like simple grouping of common extensions, and is overall faster.

**ACK doesn't search SilverStripe templates (Extension: *.ss) by default, you'll need to add the following to //~/.ackrc//:
<code>
--type-set=silverstripe=.php,.php5,.js,.ss,.txt,.ini,.yml,.xml,.html,.xhtml,.htm,.css
--silverstripe
</code>

===== More Bundles =====
Textmate keeps all official Bundles in their Subversion repository.
Its easiest to check them out in the system-wide preferences directory (not your User folder) to avoid working copy conflicts.
