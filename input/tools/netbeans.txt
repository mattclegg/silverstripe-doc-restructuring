==== Using rsync to move files automatically ====
Moving files in bulk to remote servers is greatly simplified with the use of **rsync**.  Its very fast and only pushes changed files.  On linux you can set a bash script to run when you build your project (F6) to push files where you need them.

First create a script that moves your file.  This is using rsync on Linux, but you could also use a batch file on Windows.

**/path/to/ssproject/pushfiles.sh**
<code sh>
#!/bin/sh
rsync -avpc --delete /path/to/ssproject/ remotehost.com:/path/to/server/public_html/</code>
//Don't forget to chmod +x, also you may want to tweak the above to your needs.  Especially the --delete with regards to the assets folder.//

  - Right click on your project and choose **Properties**
  - Go to the **Run Configuration** and change **Run As** to **Script**
  - In **PHP Interpreter** enter **/bin/sh**
  - Select the file you created above as your **Index File**
  - Save changes

Now whenever you want to push your files to your remote server, just build the project with **F6** or the button up top.  The Output window will pop up and show you files and progress.
