====== gedit ======
[[http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/|gedit]] is the official text editor of the GNOME desktop environment.

While gedit is very basic compared with the likes of [[tools:netbeans| NetBeans]], it is extremely fast and has the huge advantage of being able to load and save directly from an ftp folder opened in the file browser.

===== Environment Setup =====
By default, GNOME does not recognise **.ss** files:

  - Right-click on the **.ss** file you want to open
  - Choose **Open with Other Application...**
  - Select **Text Editor**

Now gedit will open your **.ss** files, but it won't recognise them as html-based, so you get no syntax highlighting. To fix this, follow these steps:

  - Open up your **Home Folder**
  - Make sure **Hidden files** are shown (**CTRL-H**)
  - Browse to **.local/share/mime/packages/** and open **user-extension-ss.xml** with **Text Editor**
  - Add <code xml><sub-class-of type="text/html"/></code> below <code xml><glob pattern="*.ss"/></code> so your file looks like this: <code xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mime-info xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info">
 <mime-type type="application/x-extension-ss">
  <comment>ss document</comment>
  <glob pattern="*.ss"/>
  <sub-class-of type="text/html"/>
 </mime-type>
</mime-info>
</code>
   - Save and close **user-extension-ss.xml** and gedit
   - Open up Terminal and run <code bash>update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime</code>
   - Now when you open up .ss files they'll be coloured like html!
