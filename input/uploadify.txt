====== Introduction ======

{{http://www.carlinowebdesign.com/assets/uploadify1.png?480}}

The Uploadify module is a FormField object that handles a variety of file upload features, and integrates easily into any frontend or CMS edit form. Features include:

  * Bulk uploading
  * Upload progress
  * File type filtering
  * Upload folder selection/creation
  * Import files
  * Drag-and-drop reordering
  * Amazon S3 storage integration

====== Components ======

The Uploadify package contains the following field types:

  * FileUploadField
  * MultipleFileUploadField
  * ImageUploadField
  * MultipleImageUploadField
  * S3UploadField
  * S3MultipleUploadField

All of these components are descendants of the abstract class //UploadifyField//.

====== Usage ======

Uploadify works exactly the same way as a FileIFrameField, ImageField, or FileField. The first argument is the name of the file relationship, and the second argument is used for a label or title of the field.

===== Single File Upload =====

The most common type of file upload is a single attachment. We'll create a $has_one relationship in the page class, and add the field.

Example:

<code php>
class MyPageWithFile extends Page {
	static $has_one = array (
		'AttachedFile' => 'File'
	);
	
	public function getCMSFields() {
		$fields = parent::getCMSFields();
		$fields->addFieldToTab("Root.Content.File", new FileUploadField('AttachedFile','Upload a file'));
		return $fields;
	}
}
</code>

This is the most simple integration of an Uploadify field. It could just as easily be substituted with FileIFrame field. Notice that the name of the field is the $has_one relationship name on the page. It is not necessary to add "ID" to the name.

===== Multiple Files =====

Uploading multiple files is a little bit different, because we'll need a $has_many on the page class and a $has_one on the File class. The latter is a bit more difficult. In order to give File a $has_one, we need to either decorate the $has_one relationship, or we can subclass the File object. This example demonstrates how to create a multiple file upload for a page using a file subclass.

// MyFile.php //
<code php>
class MyFile extends File {

	static $has_one = array (
		'MyPageWithFiles' => 'MyPageWithFiles'
	);

}
</code>

// MyPageWithFiles.php //
<code php>
class MyPageWithFiles extends Page {

	static $has_many = array (
		'AttachedFiles' => 'MyFile'
	);
	
	public function getCMSFields() {
		$fields = parent::getCMSFields();
		$fields->addFieldToTab("Root.Content.Files", new MultipleFileUploadField('AttachedFiles','Upload several files'));
		return $fields;
	}
}
</code>

===== A Frontend Form Example =====

Uploadify fields are just as easy to use on the frontend as they are in the backend. No extra configuration is needed. A different template is automatically used for the frontend, and administrative features such as folder selection and file importing are removed.

In this example, we will create a job application form. We will collect a single resume and several letters of recommendation. The resumes will be limited to PDFs and recommendations will be limited to .doc or .docx. The form will store the application in the database for an administrator to view later.

==== Step 1: Create the Job Application object ====

The form will save into an object so that it can be stored in the database.

// JobApplication.php //

<code php>
class JobApplication extends DataObject
{
	static $db = array (
		'FirstName' => 'Text',
		'LastName' => 'Text',
		'Email' => 'Text',
		'Position' => "Enum('Sales, Marketing, Logistics')"
	);
	
	static $has_one = array (
		'Resume' => 'File'
	);
	
	static $has_many = array (
		'Recommendations' => 'RecommendationFile'
	);
}
</code>

Because we have a $has_many relationship for files, we need to create a File subclass to create the $has_one back to JobApplication. This is not necessary for Resume, because there is only one of those allowed.

// RecommendationFile.php //

<code php>
class RecommendationFile extends File 
{
	static $has_one = array (
		'JobApplication' => 'JobApplication',
		'StaffMemberPage' => 'StaffMemberPage'
	);
}
</code>

Now it is necessary to run a /dev/build, and make sure the database gets updated.

==== Step 2: Build the form ====

We'll create a new page type to display the form.

// JobApplicationPage.php //

<code php>
class JobApplicationPage extends Page
{

}

class JobApplicationPage_Controller extends Page_Controller
{
	public function ApplyForm() {
		$form = new Form (
			$this,
			"ApplyForm",
			new FieldSet (
				new TextField('FirstName', _t('JobApplication.FIRSTNAME','First name')),
				new TextField('LastName', _t('JobApplication.LASTNAME','Last name')),
				new EmailField('Email', _t('JobApplication.EMAIL','Email')),
				new DropdownField('Position', _t('JobApplication.POSITION','Position applying for'), singleton('JobApplication')->dbObject('Position')->enumValues()),
				$resume = new FileUploadField('Resume', _t('JobApplication.RESUME','Upload a resume')),				
				$recommendations = new MultipleFileUploadField('Recommendations', _t('JobApplication.RECOMMENDATIONS','Upload several letters of recommendation'))
			),
			new FieldSet (
				new FormAction('doApply', _t('JobApplication.APPLYNOW','Apply now'))
			),
			new RequiredFields('FirstName','LastName','Email','Position')
		);
		$resume->setFileTypes(array(
			'pdf'
		));
		$recommendations->setFileTypes(array(
			'doc',
			'docx'
		));
		
		return $form;
	}
	
}
</code>

Here we have a pretty straightforward form, but the important thing to notice is that all of the field names are consistent with those of the JobApplication object, e.g. "FirstName, "Position", etc. This is because the form will save into the JobApplication dataobject. If we were not doing that, this consistency would not be necessary.

Notice that the form action "doApply" is specified in the actions FieldSet, but it has not been defined. That will be the next step.
==== Step 3: Handle the form ====

Create the following action in JobApplicationPage_Controller class.

// JobApplicationPage.php //
<code php>
	public function doApply($data, $form) {
		$form->saveInto($application = new JobApplication());
		$application->write();
		return array (
			'Application' => $application
		);
	
	}
</code>

This really simple handler is all we need to save a form whose fields are already in alignment with the JobApplication dataobject. If we were not saving the data to a the database, we might do something like this:

<code php>
public function doApply($data, $form) {
	$from = $data['Email'];
	$to = "administrator@mysite.com";
	$subject = "New job application";
	$body = "Someone submitted a job application. The files are attached.";
	$email = new Email($from, $to, $subject, $body);
	if(isset($data['ResumeID'])) {
		if($file = DataObject::get_by_id("File", (int) $data['ResumeID'])) {
			$email->attachFile($file->getFullPath(), $file->Name);
		}
	}
	if(isset($data['Recommendations']) && is_array($data['Recommendations'])) {
		foreach($data['Recommendations'] as $id) {
			if($file = DataObject::get_by_id("File", (int) $id)) {
				$email->attachFile($file->getFullPath(), $file->Name);
			}
		}
	}
	$email->send();
        $form->sessionMessage("Thank you for submitting your application","good");
        return Director::redirectBack();	
}

</code>

Notice that the single file is sent as [RelationshipName]ID, but the multiple file relation is sent as an array of IDs under the name [Relationship].

Let's look again at the first doApply() function. The return value is an array containing the application object.

<code php>
return array (
       'Application' => $application
);
</code>

The field "Application" will be available on the template. Let's examine how we can handle that.

// JobApplicationPage.ss //

<code html>
<div class="typography">
		
	<h1>$Title</h1>
	<div id="FormContainer">
		<% if Application %>
			<p>Thank you for applying. You entered the following information:</p>
			<% control Application %>
				<div>$FirstName $LastName</div>
				<div>$Email</div>
				<div>$Position</div>

				<% if Resume %>
				<h3>Resume</h3>
					<div>Resume: $Resume.Name <a href="$Resume.URL">download</a></div>
				<% end_if %>
				<% if Recommendations %>
					<h3>Recommendations</h3>
					<% control Recommendations %>
						<div>$Name <a href="$URL">download</a></div>	
					<% end_control %>
				<% end_if %>
			<% end_control %>
		<% end_if %>
		$ApplyForm
	</div>
</div>
</code>
If the application is available, we enter a control and show the components, and prove the integrity of the data by offering a download link.

If the application isn't available, we simply invoke $ApplyForm to show the form.


===== Configuration =====

Uploadify fields are highly configurable, allowing custom upload scripts, file type filtering, choosing upload behaviours, and more. There are three ways to set configuration values.

==== Setting a value globally ====

To set a value across all Uploadify form fields, invoke the static method // set_var($var, $value) //. For instance, to set the text of the browse button on all Uploadify fields, use this command:

<code php>
UploadifyField::set_var('buttonText', 'Click me!');
</code>

These global settings can be placed anywhere, as long as they will be read before the form is rendered. A _config.php file, or somewhere in your getCMSFields() function will work fine.

==== Setting a value for only one instance ====

To set a value for just one Uploadify field instance, use the object method // setVar($var, $value) //. For example, to set the button text on just one Uploadify field, use this command:

<code php>
$uploadify = new FileUploadField('SomeFile','Some title');
$uploadify->setVar('buttonText','Click me!');
</code>

==== Setting values in the constructor ====

You can set several values at once by supplying an array of parameters and their values in the third argument of the constructor.

<code php>
$uploadify = new FileUploadField('SomeFile', 'Some title', array (
'buttonText' => 'Click me!',
'script' => '/path/to/custom/upload/script/'
));
</code>

==== Magic settings ====

There are a few object methods that can be used to configure some common behaviours.
 
  * // imagesOnly() // -- Sets the uploader to only accept image files (see UploadifyField::$image_extensions)
 
  * // setFileTypes() // -- Takes an array of acceptable file types for the uploader. Note that using setVar('fileExt') is a little more cumbersome because it takes a string of types separated by semicolons. This method creates the string automatically.
 
  * // allowFolderSelection() // -- Available on backend uploaders only. Allows the user to select the destination folder for the uploaded file.
 
  * // addParam($key, $value) // -- Adds an extra POST parameter to send to the upload script.
 
  * // uploadOnSubmit() // -- Holds queued files until the form is submitted. Files are then uploaded and the form is submitted on complete.

 

===== Amazon S3 Integration =====

Amazon S3 is a solution for data storage that is becoming increasingly popular, especially for sites that require a lot of storage for user-submitted data. Uploadify field comes with a set of tools that make Amazon S3 storage easy and seamless.

==== Step 1: Set up the S3 integration ====

If you have have an S3 account, you should have an "access key" and a "secret key". Set up the authorization in your _config.php file.

<code php>
S3File::set_auth($access_key, $secret_key);
</code>

If you have a bucket you want to use globally, you can set that up, as well.

<code php>
S3File::set_default_bucket('my-bucket');
</code>

The only change needed for the upload fields themselves is to use "S3UploadField" or "S3MultipleUploadField" in place of "FileUploadField" and "MultipleFileUploadField."

Let's create a S3FilePage.

// S3FilePage.php //

<code php>
class S3FilePage extends Page
{
	static $has_one = array (
		'S3Test' => 'S3File'
	);
	
	
	public function getCMSFields() {
		$f = parent::getCMSFields();
		$f->addFieldToTab("Root.Content.S3 Storage", $s3 = new S3UploadField('S3Test','Send a file to Amazon S3'));
                $s3->setVar('s3bucket', 'some-other-bucket');
		
		return $f;
	}
}

</code>

Here we have overridden the default bucket set in the _config.php, and used a custom bucket for this instance.

==== A note about S3File objects ====

Because S3File is not a subclass of File, it lacks a lot of the features you may be used to when working with Files, although, some of the most important ones, such as Icon() and URL(), have been ported over.  Without physical files in the local filesystem, the File table would get compromised when FileSystem::sync(); is run in AssetAdmin (and other places). So until further notice, S3File records are stored as DataObject subclasses, and are largely agnostic of the the File class.

Amazon S3 does not have a way of negotiating name conflicts, so S3File has a built-in mechanism to ensure uniqueness by appending a uniqid() to the filenames. You can disable this feature by using

<code php>
S3File::disable_unique_id();
</code>




===== Authentication =====

Authenticating requests made by Uploadify fields is challenging, since it is actually a Flash object that is contacting the server. Because the request comes from a foreign origin, the session data is lost, and Flash is considered a new user. The upload handler knows nothing about the user who actually uploaded the file.

An easy solution to this problem is to pass PHPSESSID as a request parameter to the upload handler. Uploadify does this automatically. However, some hosting environments do not allow sessions to be started based on request data. They may have the setting // session_use_only_cookies // on. If this is the case, Uploadify will fall back on a // public // controller for the uploads. Please note, there is a security risk associated with using a public-facing controller, and it is best to turn the // session_use_only_cookies // off if possible.

Public-facing upload controllers include:

  * UploadifyUploader.php
  * S3Uploader.php

To determine if your server is capable of authenticating Uploadify, simply get the boolean value:

<code php>
var_dump(UploadifyField::can_authenticate());
</code>

===== Troubleshooting =====

The most common problem we see in Uploadify uploads is that the status bar returns "HTTP Error." This vague error is often all that is available, because Flash can only report the HTTP response code, and not necessarily the error text itself.

An easy, but tedious way to troubleshoot your upload is to packet sniff the request using a tool such as Wireshark. Otherwise, add die('hello'); statements to various points of Uploadify::upload() (or S3UploadField::uploads3()). Uploadify will alter the die statement if it has gotten that far in the function. Otherwise, it will return an HTTP Error, and you need to move the die statement up further. Eventually, you will find the line that is causing the problem.
