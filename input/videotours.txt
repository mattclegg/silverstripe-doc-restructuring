===== Doing the official CMS and Dev overview videos ====

  * http://www.silverstripe.org/assets/video/dev.html

== Tools used ==
  * Created on Mac OS X environment (by Siggy)
  * iShowU used for screen capture (http://shinywhitebox.com/)
  * Apple iMovie used for editing, condensing, and concatenating screencaptures (e.g. for CMS overview)
  * Apple Keynote used for explanations (e.g. for developer tutorial)
  * ffmpegx used to convert .MOV quicktime into .FLV flash video (http://homepage.mac.com/major4/)
  * flvtool2 used to add metadata to FLV files so that you can seek around them and show progress (http://www.inlet-media.de/flvtool2). Requires compiling on MacOSX.
  * jp media player used to embed FLV files when playing (http://www.jeroenwijering.com/)

== Procedure ==
  * Current screencaptures of CMS are in a Firefox 2 window (on MacOS X) of 975x779 (TBC?).
  * Update iMovie/Keynote files as needed.
  * Export iMovie and Keynote files as Quicktime H264 at 1024x768 resolution, highest quality, frame-reordering, double-pass.
  * Convert to FLV (ffmpeg) to 768x576 (a 4:3 ratio), no sound, 400kbit video.
  * Run flvtool2 on completed FLV files (adds a few kilobytes only)
    * e.g.: ruby /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/flvtool2.rb dev.flv -UP
  * Upload to silverstripe.com/assets/video/

== Jp media player settings ==
  * Reference: http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Supported_Flashvars
  * width=768
  * height=596 (576 plus 20 pixels for the progress bar shown along the bottom)
  * autostart=true
  * searchbar=false

== Typical resulting file-size ==
  * Aim for ~50 kb/second maximum.
    * CMS.flv: 25,833KB (8 minutes)
    * DEV.flv: 12,303KB (4 minutes)



==== Doing youtube screencasts ====
  * Use iShowU HD to capture the footage for the screencast, and iMovie to edit.

  * When using iShowU beware of its tendency to 'letterbox'(black lines at top and bottom of video). This can easily be cropped out in iMovie. (There may be a setting in iShowU to prevent this, if you know what it is let us know!)

  * Mouse mode in iShowU: the 'Follow' option can look a bit unsettling if moving the mouse around a lot in the video. I found the 'Fixed' option worked well for most footage.

  * When slowing down footage from iShowU in iMovie it can lose quality and become slightly blurry, which can make the text hard to read, especially in a youtube sized video. It can be better to simply take the footage slowly in iShowU instead of trying to slow it down later.

  * Ideally, upload as 1280x720 resolution for HD quality.
    * Check official FAQ to confirm this is still accurate: http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=132460
