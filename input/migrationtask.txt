====== Migration Task ======
Migration task is the task you should subclass to migrate your data from one structure to another structure. 

===== Creating Migration Tasks =====
To create your own migration task all you need to do is define your own subclass of MigrationTask and define the following functions

**mysite/code/MyMigrationTask.php**
<code php>
class MyMigrationTask extends BuildTask {
	
	protected $title = "My Database Migrations"; // title of the script
	protected $description = "Description"; // description of what it does
	
	function run($request) {
		if ($request->param('Direction') == 'down') {
			$this->down();
		} else {
			$this->up();
		}
	}
	
	function up() {
		// do something when going from old -> new
	}
	
	function down() {
		// do something when going from new -> old
	}	
}
</code>

===== Running Migration Tasks =====
To run any tasks you can find them under the dev/ namespace. To run the above script you would need to run the following and note - Either the site has to be in [[debugging|devmode]] or you need to add ?isDev=1 to the URL

<code>
// url to visit if in dev mode.
http://www.yoursite.com/dev/tasks/MyMigrationTask

// url if you are in live mode but need to run this
http://www.yoursite.com/dev/tasks/MyMigrationTask?isDev=1
</code>
