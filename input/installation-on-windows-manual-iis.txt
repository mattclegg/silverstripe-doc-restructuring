This page explains installing SilverStripe manually, without the use of (the easy to use) Web Platform Installer, and instead of Apache on Windows. See [[installation-on-windows]] to learn about those ways to install SilverStripe on Windows.
===== IIS 7.x =====

IIS 7.x ships with Windows Vista and Server 2008 or later.

A [[installation-on-windows-server-manual-iis|full guide is available]] on installing SilverStripe on Windows Server, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7.



===== IIS 6 =====

IIS 6 ships with Windows Server 2003.

This guide will help you get SilverStripe installed on IIS 6 and use a third-party tool called IIRF for rewriting: http://doc.silverstripe.org/installation-on-windows-server-2003-iis-6

===== Installing on IIS 5.1 and 6.0 =====

  * Microsoft has no URL rewriting module for anything less than IIS 7.x. This will mean your URLs are like yoursite.com/index.php/about-us rather than yoursite.com/about-us. However, if you do want friendly URLs you must you must buy or use other URL rewriting software: 
    * IIRF: http://iirf.codeplex.com/
    * ISAPI_Rewrite: http://www.helicontech.com/download-isapi_rewrite3.htm
       * (The freeware, lite version should be fine for simple installations.)
    * If you have 64-bit windows, you can try this one: 
        * http://www.micronovae.com/ModRewrite/ModRewrite.html
  * Instructions for installing PHP IIS 5.1 and 6 may be different that for 7. See http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/248/configuring-fastcgi-extension-for-iis60/
  * On XP, you need to disable 'Check that file exists' (See [[installation-on-windows-pi]])
