===== Introduction =====

Base controller class.  You will extend this to take granular control over the actions and url handling of aspects of your SilverStripe site.


===== Example =====
mysite/code/Controllers/FastFood.php
<code php>
<?php

class FastFood_Controller extends Controller {
    function order($arguments) {
        print_r($arguments);
    }
}

?>
</code>

mysite/_config.php

<code php>
Director::addRules(50, array('fastfood/$Action/$ID/$Name' => 'FastFood_Controller'));
</code>

Request for '/fastfood/order/24/cheesefries' would result in the following to the $arguments above. If needed, use "?flush=1" on the end of request after making any code changes to your controller.
<code html>
Array
(
    [Action] => order
    [ID] => 24
    [Name] => cheesefries
)
</code>

===== URL Handling =====
In the above example the URLs were configured using the [[director]] rules in the **_config.php** file.  Alternatively you can specify these in your Controller class via the **$url_handlers** static array (which gets processed by the RequestHandler).  

This is useful when you want to subvert the fixed action mapping of 'fastfood/order/*' to the function **order**.  In the case below we also want any orders coming through '/fastfood/drivethrough/' to use the same order function.

mysite/code/Controllers/FastFood.php

<code php>
class FastFood_Controller extends Controller {
    public static $url_handlers = array(
            'drivethrough/$Action/$ID/$Name' => 'order'
            );
</code>


===== URL Patterns =====

The RequestHandler class will parse all rules you specify against the following patterns.

**A rule must always start with alphabetical ([A-Za-z]) characters or a $Variable declaration**

| **Pattern** | **Description** |
|  **$**  | **Param Variable ** - Starts the name of a paramater variable, it is optional to match this unless ! is used  |
|  **!**  | **Require Variable** - Placing this after a parameter variable requires data to be present for the rule to match |
|  **%%//%%**  | **Shift Point** - Declares that only variables denoted with a $ are parsed into the $params AFTER this point in the regex |

====== Examples ======

See maetl's article in the Links below of a detailed explanation. 

**'$Action%%//%%$ID/$OtherID'** - Standard URL handler for a Controller.  Take whatever URLSegment it is set to, find the Action to match a function in the Controller, and parse two optional $param variables that will be named ID and OtherID.


**'admin/help%%//%%$Action/$ID'** - Match an url starting with /admin/help/, but don't include /help/ as part of the action (the shift point is set to start parsing variables and the appropriate controller action AFTER the //)


**'tag/$Tag!'** - Match an URL starting with /tag/ after the controller's URLSegment and require it to have something after it.  If the URLSegment is **order** then '/order/tag/34' and '/order/tag/asdf' match but '/order/tag/' will not


You can use the **debug_request=1** switch from the [[urlvariabletools]] to see these in action.
