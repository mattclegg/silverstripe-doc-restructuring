====== FlickrService ======

You can use FlickrService to create mashups based on Flickr's data API. This class comes with built-in ability to retrieve photos based on tags, user or photoset. You can further extend it to suit your requirements. 

Refer [[http://www.flickr.com/services/api|Flickr API]] for more methods.

===Setting the API key===
  * First of all you have to set the API key for the flickr service (which is obtainable from http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/) in the _config.php file in the mashups module directory. 
  <code>
    FlickrService::setAPIKey('c88164229499662e1497335950c61eeb'); 
  </code>

===Implementing to Flickr Service===
  * First you have to create a new FlickrService object in your controller.
  <code>
    $flickr = new FlickrService();
  </code>

===Searching for photos===
  * By using getPhotos method you could search for photos of a particular tag or user.
  * To find photos by tags pass the tag names separated by commas as the first argument.
    <code>
        $photos = $flickr->getPhotos("cricket,football");
     </code>
  * If you want to find photos of a particular user you can pass the Flickr username of that user as a string.
 * To control the number of images per page use the 3rd argument, where you could pass in the number of images you need.
  <code>
    $photos = $flickr->getPhotos("", "username", 5);
  </code>
 
===Getting a Photoset===
  * to retrieve a photoset use the following function.
   <code>
      	$photos = $flickr->getPhotoSet("photoset-id", "username", limit);
   </code>

===Displaying Flickr Photos===
  * To display your photos you could have the following code in your template.
  <code>
      <% control FlickrPhotos.PhotoItems %>
	<a href="$page_url"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/{$image_path}_s.jpg"/></a>
      <% end_control %>
  </code>
