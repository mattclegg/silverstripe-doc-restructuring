====== Virtual Page ======

Virtual Page creates an instance of a page in another part of the site, which has the same fields that the original page had. In SilverStripe the fields are represented as [[#readonly]] fields, but on templates, all the fields are available just like the original class.

This class is part of the core classes which make SilverStripe's Navigation tools.
