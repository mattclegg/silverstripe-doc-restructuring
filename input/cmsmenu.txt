====== cmsmenu ======

===== Introduction =====

Introduced in 2.3.0, CMSMenu controls the menu items in the top portion of the page within the CMS.

===== Default Behaviour =====

The menu will be automatically populated with menu items for subclasses of [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/cms/core/LeftAndMain.html|LeftAndMain]]. That is, for each class in the CMS that creates an administration panel, a CMS menu item will be created. The default configuration will also include a 'help' link to the SilverStripe user documentation.

===== Modifying the Menu =====

===== Adding a Controller =====

Usually, a valid administration page is a subclass of [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/cms/core/LeftAndMain.html|LeftAndMain]] or [[ModelAdmin]] (itself a subclass of [[http://api.silverstripe.org/trunk/cms/core/LeftAndMain.html|LeftAndMain]]), so it is added automatically.





===== Adding a Link =====

Additional links can be added to the menu with the call:

<code php>
CMSMenu::add_link($code, $menuTitle, $url, $priority = -1)
</code>

$code is a unique name that you can use later to refer to the menu item.

$menuTitle (string) is the title as it appears in the menu. You should apply any translations at this point.

$url (string) is where you want the menu item to link to

$priority is the order in which the menu item appears, with a lower number pushing the item to the left.

===== Removing an Item =====

You can remove an item using the call:

<code php>
CMSMenu::remove_menu_item($code)
</code>

$code is a unique name of the menu item - usually the admin controller class, or a arbitrary name given to a link when it is added.
