====== Usage ======

One of the first things you'll notice about the Postale module that makes it different from other modules is that there is no CMS interface. This is because there is no concept of multiple message pages, so the messages feature of a website is treated only as a controller, and not a data model. 

That being said, there is still a lot to configure in the Postale module. Rather than editing page in the CMS, this can all be done by modifying static class properties in your _config.php file.

===== Basic Settings =====
Here is an example of the configuration needed for some of the most important settings in the Postale module.
<code php>
MessagesPage::set_url("messages");
MessagesPage::$from_address = "Your Site <webmaster@mysite.com>";
MessagesPage::$from_name = "Web Site";
</code>

The first setting is for the url segment of the messages section. This will set the property and also add a rule to Director to point to the MessagesPage controller.

The second setting is the address from which the new messages notifications will originate.

Lastly, the third setting is for the closing section of the new message email. In this example, the text will read:

// Sincerely,
Web Site //

===== Advanced Settings =====

You may also wish to add:

<code php>
MessagesPage::$messages_per_page = 10; // defaults to 25
MessagesPage::$summary_length = 100; // Length of a message body summary, in characters. Defaults to 40
</code>

===== Template customisation =====

It is likely that you will want to override some or all of the templates included with the Postale module to fit better into your site design. To do that, just copy the template you want to override to the respective directory in your theme. 

For instance, to override the //MessagesInterface.ss// template:

Copy // /postale/templates/Includes/MessagesInterface.ss // to // /themes/your_theme/templates/Includes/MessagesInterface.ss // and make any necessary changes there.

Likewise, to override the new message notification template:

Copy // /postale/templates/MessageNotification.ss // to // /themes/your_theme/templates/MessageNotification.ss //.

===== CSS customisation =====

Postale is a themeable module, so all you need to do is include a // messages.css // stylesheet in your theme to override the core stylesheet. Most of the time, you will want to copy over the contents of the original stylesheet and make any necessary modifications from within your theme.
