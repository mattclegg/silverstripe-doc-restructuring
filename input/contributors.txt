====== Who contributes to SilverStripe? ======

===== Silverstripe Core =====
The overall SilverStripe project is managed by Sam Minnée (sminnee) and Ingo Schommer (ischommer, chillu).
They coordinate the opensource effort, community communication and keep an eye on the bigger picture. Of course there are many other contributors, as employees of [[http://silverstripe.com/company|Silverstripe Ltd]] or as coders from all around the world. You can meet most of these fellows on our [[http://silverstripe.org/irc-channel/|IRC channel]].

The opensource contributor platform [[http://www.ohloh.net/projects/silverstripe|Ohloh]] provides a good overview of current core contributions.

===== Silverstripe Modules =====
[[module-maintainers|Module maintainers]] are usually noted in the README file of a specific module. You can [[http://open.silverstripe.com/browser/modules|browse the source of all modules]] to find those files. Frequent contributors to a module are best identified by looking at the subversion changelog.

===== Types of Contributors =====
==== Patch Contributors ====
Anyone can submit a patch, but some people are recognised as regularly contributing patches to a particular part of the core or module.  We endeavour to review all patches that are submitted as quickly as possible, and if they meet our requirements, merge them into trunk. See [[subversion]] for information on how to create patches.

==== Branch Committers ====
Sometimes, the volume of working being contributed will mean that merging patches is too much of an administrative burden.  In these cases, we can set up a **temporary feature branch** for that conributor. See [[subversion]] for details on how to use feature branches.

==== Maintainers ====
The highest level of access are the maintainers, as described on [[module-maintainers]].  They have commit rights to trunk, as well as the ability to create branches and tags.  Generally only the key people working on a module will have trunk committer access. See [[subversion]] for infos how to commit to the repository and tag new releases.
